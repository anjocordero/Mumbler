Back against the wall, middle fingers in the air
Bustin' through the crowd, they gon' feel me now
Straight shooter from the hip, yeah, we heavy in it
Told me get them, then I got 'em, yeah (Get 'em)
99 Problems, but you ain't one
Been so high lately I don't care what's goin' down
You can see it in my eyes, he be hittin' it right
Got me wishin' that he wasn't on the low
And I need it all night
Real love, show me what it feels like
Fuck it, I'll let you pull up on me broad daylight
Shots over, yeah, fuck the other side
We don't gotta lay low, we grown
Field-trippin', I don't need no chaperone
I'm tryna get ghost, oh, oh
(Another one)
It's just us against the world
In this life of sin
Ain't nobody gonna take us out
It's always us, it's never them
It's just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, it's never them
It's lovely at the top, private destination
Sip it on the rocks, only way with us
This kind of love dangerous when there's nothin' else to lose
So don't make me ride alone, no (Let's ride)
Got 99 Problems, what's one more?
Fifty feet, get you touched at your front door
Livin' fast and we spinnin' slow
Side eyes let me know that we visible
And I need it right now (Yeah)
Ten toes down, show me what it's all about
Thuggin', we only duckin' when the boys come out
It's us over them, fuck the other side
We won't turn the lights off, we hot
All we do and don't nobody gotta know
I'm tryna get ghost, oh yes
Oh, oh
It's just us against the world
In this life of sin
Ain't nobody gonna pick a side
It's always us, it's never them
It's just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, it's never them
(This how a angel sounds)
It's just us, it's just us, it's just us
(It's just us)
It's always us, it's always us
(It's only us)
It's just us, it's just us
It's always, it's always us, it's always us
It's just us against the world
In this life of sin
Ain't nobody gonna pick a side
It's always us, it's never them
It's just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, it's never them
You all that I need
It's just, uh, it's just us, it's just us
(We The Best Music)
It's always, it's always us, it's always us
It's just, uh, it's just us, it's just us
(Another one)
It's always, it's always us, it's always
