Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights have we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like "'Could y'all get any closer?"
They wanna know what's up when I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What you say we make it true?
We make it true
Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What you say we make it true, baby?
Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep 'em talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
Tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What you say we make it...
Make it true?
What you say we make it true? Yeah
