Ayy, let's party, holmes
Invite all the bitches
Hundreds and fifties, big ol' bitties, ayy?
Uno, dos, no tres, you heard me?
Ayy (Almighty)
Ayy, it cost to live like this, you heard me?
Uno, dos, no tres, she a thot, though
We got bitches shaking ass in the lot, though
Big chop knock a nigga out zapatos
Still getting queso like nachos
Uno, dos, no tres, she a thot, though
We got bitches shaking ass in the lot, though
Big chop knock a nigga out zapatos
Still getting queso like nachos
Hit it from the back, then I tell her, "No más"
She a freak, had to tell a bitch, "Hola"
Bend it over, I want your panocha
She call me papi, I hit it with no socks
She like, "Jay, can I get some dick, por favor?"
I'm like "Yeah, take it out, close the door"
Chopper go blocka, yeah, we fin' to up the score
And peel a nigga back like a fuckin' orange
Uno, dos, no tres, she a thot, though
We got bitches shaking ass in the lot, though
Big chop knock a nigga out zapatos
Still getting queso like nachos
Uno, dos, no tres, she a thot, though
We got bitches shaking ass in the lot, though
Big chop knock a nigga out zapatos
Still getting queso like nachos
I told her pull up on the kid mañana
I beat the pussy up like a piñata
I tell her work that thing like Rihanna
Hit her from the back, she gon' call me papa
Bend it over, yeah, make it clap quick
Dunk in her pussy, yeah, I'm on that Shaq shit
So fly, post a pic with no caption
My Mexican bitch got an English accent
Uno, dos, no tres, she a thot, though
We got bitches shaking ass in the lot, though
Big chop knock a nigga out zapatos
Still getting queso like nachos
Uno, dos, no tres, she a thot, though
We got bitches shaking ass in the lot, though
Big chop knock a nigga out zapatos
Still getting queso like nachos
