(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
You make me happy, this you can bet, yeah
You stood right beside me, yeah, and I won't forget
And I really love you, you should know
I want to make sure I'm right, boy, before I let go, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Now, we had a good time, that we can say
We hurted each other, yeah, and, boy, it's a shame
I won't be foolish, no, I wanna know
I want to make sure I'm right, boy, before I let go, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I thank God' sun rises and shines on you
You know there's nothing
Nothing, nothing I would not do, whoa
Before I let you go, woah
I would never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never
Let you go before I go
I pull up to Coachella (Pull up)
In boots with the goose feathers (Pull up)
I brought the squad with me (Pull up)
Black on black bandanas
Aight, D'USSÃ‰ and champagne (Chins up)
I did the damn thing
Dirty Diana, singin' and dancing all in the rain
Ooh (To the left)
I just wanna have a good time (Turn around)
Turn around, dip then slide
And twirl that ass to the right now
Ooh
Bunny hop, bunny hop, drop, pop
Cross your legs, turn around and clap
And shuffle to the left, let's glide now
Ooh
Drop it down, drop it down low, low
Low, low, low to the floor
Bring it up, clap, then roll
Step on 'em, step on 'em, step on 'em, step
Step on 'em, kick on 'em, stomp and you step
Swag the right, surf the left
Work the middle
'Til it hurt a little
(Before I let)
(Before I let, be- befo- before I let go)
(Before I let)
(Before I let, be- befo- before I let go)
