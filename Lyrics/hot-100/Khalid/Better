I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up
I'm not, I'm so sober
I love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(I love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm good on this side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm good on this side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's got to know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's got to know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street
So hit me when you need and it's yours
All I hear is...
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, ooh now
We don't gotta hide
This is what you like, gotta admit
Nothing feels better than this
You say we're just friends, but I swear when nobody's around
(You say we're just friends, but I swear when nobody's around)
I keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feelin' it now?
(I keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feelin' it now?)
'Cause I am
I get so high that I ignite, I swear to God, feel my feet leave the ground
(I get so high that I ignite, I swear to God, feel my feet leave the ground)
Ooh, yeah
Your back against the wall, this is what you been talkin' about
In my ears
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, ooh now
We don't gotta hide
This is what you like, gotta admit
Nothing feels better than this
You know that if I left
I'd take you back
When you say it, you say it like that, oh yeah
You know that if I left
I'd take you back
When you say it, you say it like
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
(Nothing feels better) ooh now, now
We don't gotta hide
(This is what you like, gotta admit)
Nothing feels better than this
(Better than this)
Nothing feels better than this
