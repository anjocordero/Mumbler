Power, got me sitting by my phone
I been waiting for hours
Am I lost in the mirror
Picture you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place
It's cloudy in LA, but I'll be there at 8
If the traffic allows it
Sit you down I can show you around if you really about it
But for you I got something to prove
What do you say?
What do you say?
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly it's better like that
I know we been falling off track
Bring it right back
We just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just want to take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back
Say, got the weed, we can sit by the beach
If you want to get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah it's cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around
Now I know we're not dating
Maybe soon
By the way things go we been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down
We just need to be patient
If the love feels good and it's real it will all work out
It will all work out, yeah
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly it's better like that
I know we been falling off track
Bring it right back
We just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just want to take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it back
So bring it back
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it
So bring it back
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it
So bring it back
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly it's better like that
I know we been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just want to take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back
Honestly it's better like that
I know we been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just want to take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right
