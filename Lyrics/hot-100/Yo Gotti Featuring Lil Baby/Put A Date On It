[Intro:]
June you're a genius
Yuh
[Yo Gotti:]
Sack coming in and the money don't fold (Fold)
Gotta put a stamp on it (Stamp on it)
Just hit a play, scrape it off the plate (Skrrt)
Gotta put the cap on it (Cap on it)
Pussy ass nigga always talking that tough shit
Nigga, put a date on it (Date on it)
Everybody sittin' at the table round here, yeah
There's a lot of plates on it
[Lil Baby:]
Running through the money and the bitch keep callin'
Hold up, she gon have to wait on it
VVS diamond drippin' over my t-shirt
Reach for it, I'ma put your face on it
Rolls Royce truck on the way, cashed out for it
Still had to way on it
Plug fucked around and sent the wrong damn kind
Nigga still had to pay for it
[Yo Gotti:]
Pack coming in on
[?]
(Woo)
I'ma keep a 30 in my 40 (Slatt)
I'ma buy a Birkin for my shawty
Nigga did me dirty, ran off on me (Took off)
Plug did me dirty, took off on me
Lil hitta just folded, got soft on me
I'm from the streets, you gotta pay with your life
I got away with the white
You just like your father and he was a rat (Uh)
So that means he raising a mice (Yeah)
I had to trap through the night (Yeah)
I put that pack on a flight (Yeah)
I shot all them pussies the same night (Brrrrt)
Layed in the bushes, a rainy night
Won't put no hoes on a pedestal
Edibles, I'm tryna fuck 'em the same night
I put 2 hoes on the same flight
Cooked up 2 bricks in the same pot (Work)
I shot 4 niggas, the same Glock (Bop, bop, bop)
Too many you niggas got the same watch
Why you compete with me nigga?
We are not playing with the same chick
It's murder, more murder for hire
And that shit been stuck on my mindset

Hundred dollars off a iPhone
I ain't talking show money
Plug keep calling, we gon take his ass down (Hold up)
That'll be some more money
Labels talking contracts, I ain't signing shit (Nope)
Tell 'em that I
[?]
money
I used to shop with a bitch, she got 'em low
She kept it realer than niggas
But she get a number better than these bookies I'm gettin'
I swear that I'm floodin' the city
A rap nigga better not diss me cause I'm round them hittas
Everywhere I go, they with me
Pack coming in on a back street
12 ride by, man he still keep workin'
Get 50 thousand dollars for a show
Knowing God damn well niggas still ain't workin'
I been told these folks I quit
Knowing God damn well niggas still sippin' syrup
Got the trap goin' crazy like the first or the third
Got a lot of cash money, I could still get birds
Get away with my chain, he gon still get murked
Had a FN on me when I did this verse
If she suck good dick, she gon leave with a purse
I was really in the streets, you can do your research
