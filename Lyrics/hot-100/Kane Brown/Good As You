See the way you're taking care of your momma
The way you're taking care of me
The way you light up any room girl
You're what this world should be
Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So starting right now girl,
Tell me everything you need
I just wanna wake up every day here in this bed
And never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
Girl, you're more than just a surface
Yeah, you got that heart of gold
So when it comes to lovin' you baby
Nah, it'll never get old
Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So starting right now girl,
Tell me everything you need
I just wanna wake up every day here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
(Good as you, baby)
I just wanna wake up every day here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
I just wanna wake up every day here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
Baby, I just wanna be good as you
