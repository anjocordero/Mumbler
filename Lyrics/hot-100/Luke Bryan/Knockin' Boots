This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me 'cross town to you
That dress needs a slip-off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth
Yeah birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
Fishin' in the dark needs nitty gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawn, hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, me and you, oh
Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you want me tonight
Sing-alongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need to call that cab
And back seats need "I want you so bad"
Yeah birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
Fishin' in the dark needs nitty gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawn, hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin boots, girl, me and you
Doors need shuttin'
Lights need cuttin'
Lips need lockin'
Boots need knockin'
And birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
Fishin' in the dark needs nitty gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawn, hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, me and you
Oh, knockin' boots
