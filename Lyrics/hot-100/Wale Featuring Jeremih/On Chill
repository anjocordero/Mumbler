[Jeremih (Wale):]
We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too
We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight (One time)
Maybe I can give you chills too (Chill)
[Wale:]
I'm gettin' mine like fine wine measured in time
Many other brothers loved you but this pleasure is mine
It's no pressure for us to say that I love you for now
So fuck that cuffin' shit, I just wanna be comfortable now, for real
Who you lovin'? Who you wanna pull up with?
Who don't care who you datin' long as you care and you trust him
Tryna hear all your problems so I can lighten the load
No you not fighting alone, cause I'm protecting you from 'em (so chill)
Life hard and ex lovers is like scars
Cause they stop hurting but never forgetting what it was
I was a youngin' my biggest enemy was the club
With voicemails on third ring fucking me up
So 'on trust
