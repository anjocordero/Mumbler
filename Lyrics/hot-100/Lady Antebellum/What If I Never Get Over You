It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart
But the moving on is the hardest part
It comes in waves, the letting go
But the memory fades, everybody knows, everybody knows
What if I'm trying, but then I close my eyes and then I'm right back
Lost in that last goodbye, what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
Maybe months go by, maybe years from now
And I meet someone and it's working out
Every now and then, he can see right through
'Cause when I look at him, yeah, all I see is you
What if I'm trying, but then I close my eyes and then I'm right back
Lost in that last goodbye, what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
Ooh yeah
What if I never get over?
What if I never get closure?
What if I never get back all the wasted words I told you?
What if it never gets better?
What if this lasts forever and ever and ever, I'm tryin'
But then I close my eyes and then I'm right back
Lost in that last goodbye, what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
What if I gave you everything I got
What if your love was my one and only shot
What if I end up with nothing to compare it to
What if I never get over you
What if I never get over you?
What if I never get over you?
What if I never get over you?
