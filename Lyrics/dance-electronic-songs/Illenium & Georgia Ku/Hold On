I can't listen to these stupid songs
'Cause they all remind me that you're gone
I'm still sleeping in your favorite tee
Pictures I just can't delete
Don't know how to be, how to be alone
If I can't live without you, I can't live at all
I'm sick of finding reasons to feel the way I did before
I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna wish that you would stay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna say I'm not okay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
Why do I hold on to you?
Why do I hold on to you?
I'm still listening to this stupid song
Like I don't know where it all went wrong, mmm
All my friends are asking where you been
Memories keep on creeping in
Don't know how to be, how to be alone, hey
I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna wish that you would stay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna say I'm not okay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
Hold on to you
Why do I hold on to you?
Why do I hold on to you?
Why, oh why do I lose my mind
When I hold on tight?
No, I don't wanna let go
Why, oh why do I lose my mind
When I hold on tight?
No, I don't wanna let go
Why, oh why do I lose my mind
When I hold on tight?
No, I don't wanna let go
(Don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go)
I don't wanna let go
I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna wish that you would stay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna say I'm not okay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
