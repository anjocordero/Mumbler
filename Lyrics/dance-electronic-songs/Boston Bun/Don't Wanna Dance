B-B-Boston Bun
Please don't try to take me by the hand
Already told you that you're not my man
I don't mean that you blew your last chance
Pretty baby, I don't wanna dance
Don't wanna dance, don't wanna dance
Don't wanna, baby, I don't wanna dance
Don't wanna dance, don't wanna dance
Baby, pretty baby, I don't wanna—
Pretty baby, I don't wanna dance
I-I-I don't wanna dance
(Ooh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
(Ooh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
No-oh-oh-oh
(Ooh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
Yeah
Please don't try to take me by the hand
Already told you that you're not my man
I don't mean that you blew your last chance
Pretty baby, I don't wanna dance
(Ooh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
Don't wanna dance, don't wanna dance
(Ooh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
Don't wanna, baby, I don't wanna dance
(Ooh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
Don't wanna dance, don't wanna dance
(Ooh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
Baby, pretty baby, I don't wanna—
Pretty baby, I don't wanna dance
I-I-I don't wanna dance
(Ooh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
(Ooh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
(Ooh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
(Ooh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
