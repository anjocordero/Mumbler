I don't mind you hanging with your friends
It's just I like it more when the party ends
So we can turn our lights down, you and me now
With you, every day is like a weekend
I know they want to steal your heart away
So I just wanna keep you here with me
I'm never gonna let go, wanna stay close
Let me do it just how you want it
I want you all to myself
I want you all to myself
Your body is turning me reckless
Ooh baby, you're making me selfish
I want you all to myself
I want you all to myself
Your body is turning me reckless
Ooh baby, you're making me selfish
You make me, you make me
You make me selfish
You make me, you make me
You make me selfish
I don't mind you making other plans
It's just I like it more when they don't happen
So we can order take-out, chill on my couch
Got me looking good in my sweatpants
Did you know that posh uptown events
Are full of fake actors? No offense
I just wanna wake up with my make-up
Smeared on your sheets, makin' no sense
I want you all to myself
I want you all to myself
Your body is turning me reckless
Ooh baby, you're making me selfish
I want you all to myself
I want you all to myself
Your body is turning me reckless
Ooh baby, you're making me selfish
You make me, you make me
You make me selfish
You make me, you make me
I want you all to myself
I don't mind you hanging with your friends
It's just I like it more when the party ends
It's just I like it more when the party ends
I want you all to myself
I want you all to myself
I want you all to myself
Your body is turning me reckless
Ooh baby, you're making me selfish
I want you all to myself
I want you all to myself
Your body is turning me reckless
Ooh baby, you're making me selfish
