You like to drink and to smoke
To take away the pain
And I don't remember
All of my mistakes
And every high got low
With no one to blame
You're not alright
I'm not alright
XO
When I'm high in the shade
And I'm feeling a way
Baby hello
I just wanted to see if your plans ever change
You're my XO
Gotta fight for the love
What a rush and I don't want to let go
So don't let me go
Got no patience
Conversations driving you up the wall
I been perfect
You're a goddess
No sarcasm at all
You say you're sorry
But don't know what you're sorry for
No point in keeping score
You like to drink and to smoke
To take away the pain
And I don't remember
All of my mistakes
And every high got low
With no one to blame
You're not alright
I'm not alright
You're not alright
I'm not alright
I like to drink and to smoke
To take away the pain
And you don't remember
All of your mistakes
And when hearts aren't broke
They're out of place
You're not alright
I'm not alright
Let's roll
You and I don't belong in a place like this
Baby let's roll
We don't need to believe everything they think
When its all so
Heading down that road
You don't got to go so low
No, don't let me go
Got no patience
Conversations driving you up the wall
I been perfect
You're a goddess
No sarcasm at all
You say you're sorry
But don't know what you're sorry for
No point in keeping score
You like to drink and to smoke
To take away the pain
And I don't remember
All of my mistakes
And every high got low
With no one to blame
You're not alright
I'm not alright
Whoo
You're not alright
I'm not alright
I like to drink and to smoke
To take away the pain
And you don't remember
All of your mistakes
And when hearts aren't broke
They're out of place
You're not alright
I'm not alright
