You and I
Saw the worst of each other before
And it's hard
To get what we saw in the dark
Somewhere in the middle
In-between the light
We don't have to call it
Let it go all night
I know what you feelin'
I feel it too
Somewhere in the middle
And I'll be there for you
In the middle I'll be there
And I'll be there for you
In the middle I'll be there
We can try
To go back to the way that it was
But I'd lie
If you ask me if that's what I want
Somewhere in the middle
In-between the light
We don't have to call it
Let it go all night
I know what you feelin'
I feel it too
Somewhere in the middle
Somewhere in the middle
In-between the light
We don't have to call it
Let it go all night
I know what you feelin'
I feel it too
Somewhere in the middle
And I'll be there for you
In the middle I'll be there
Somewhere in the middle
Somewhere in the middle
I feel it too
I feel it too
