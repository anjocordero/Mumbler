Too high, too deep
It's you, it's me
Too wild to sleep, oh yeah
One thing to need
Three words I speak
When you're with me, babe
Oh come on, come on
However I act, you know how much I care
Come on, come on
You know what I want, now meet me if you dare
Live on the run, live on the run
I'll do anything to be there
Be there
And I'm always singing it like a prayer
Oh when you touch me there
Oh you'll always be my ritual
Always, love you on through the night, eh
Be there when the sun is rising
Oh you'll always be my ritual
Oh you'll always be my ritual
Oh you'll always be my ritual
You worship me
Beneath the sheets
Our love, unique
And even when...
You leave my bed
You're in my head
You're all I need
Oh come on, come on
However I act, you know how much I care
Come on, come on
You know what I want, now meet me if you dare
Live on the run, live on the run
I'll do anything to be there
Be there
And I'm always singing it like a prayer
Oh when you touch me there
Oh you'll always be my ritual
Always, love you on through the night, eh
Be there when the sun is rising
Oh you'll always be my ritual
Oh you'll always be my ritual
Oh you'll always be my ritual
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on babe
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on babe
Oh, live on the run, live on the run, live on the run babe
Oh, and I'll be there with you
And I'm always singing it like a prayer
Oh when you touch me there
Oh you'll always be my ritual
Always, love you on through the night, eh
Be there when the sun is rising
Oh you'll always be my ritual
And I'm always singing it like a prayer
Oh when you touch me there
Oh you'll always be my ritual
Always, love you on through the night, eh
Be there when the sun is rising
Oh you'll always be my ritual
You'll always be my ritual
