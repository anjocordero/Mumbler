I always stay when the night is done
You got the kind of thing I should run from
But that's the reason why it's so fun
I always come back
Sendin' all the wrong signals to my brain
Sendin' all the right feelings through my veins
I should go but I never walk away
Always make the same mistakes, no I never change
I got a thing for you
I got a thing for the things that I shouldn't do
And when I'm next to you
I get those fucked up feelings
I do 'cause I gotta thing for you
I got a thing for the things that I shouldn't do
And when I'm next to you
I get those fucked up feelings
I do 'cause I gotta
Thing for you
Thing for you
Help with things that I'm tryna fix
But I think I like all my dirty habits
Maybe I'ma little too used to it
'Cause I always come back
Sendin' all the wrong signals to my brain
Sendin' all the right feelings through my veins
I should go but I never walk away
Always make the same mistakes, no I never change
I got a thing for you
I got a thing for the things that I shouldn't do
And when I'm next to you
I get those fucked up feelings
I do 'cause I gotta thing for you
I got a thing for the things that I shouldn't do
And when I'm next to you
I get those fucked up feelings
I do 'cause I gotta
Thing for you
Thing for you
Thing for you
Thing for you
