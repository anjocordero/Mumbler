(Wish I was there for you
Wish I was there for you
Was there for you)
Waited so long
Thought you'd never come
You proved me wrong
'Cause I don't know where it felt so right
If I could go
Go back in time
What I would do
Is to love you sooner
I wish I was there for you
I wish I was holding you closer than close every day of your life
Wish I was there for you
And I wish that you were there for me too
Wish I was there for you
(There for you, there for you
There for you
There for you, there for you)
I wish I was there for you
(There for you, there for you
There for you
There for you, there for you)
(There for you
There for you, there for you
There for you
There for you, there for you)
I wish I was there for you
And I wish that you were there for me too
(There for you
There for you, there for you)
I lose my mind
Going back in time
Were you mine
Oh, mine? Oh-oh
So many years, so many tears
Wishing that you were over here
Maybe that's how it needed to be
For you to get to me
I wish I was there for you
I wish I was holding you closer than close every day of your life
I wish I was there for you
'Cause when we're together there's so much to love, there's so little time
I wish I was there for you
Wish I was holding you closer than close every day of your life
I wish I was there for you
And I wish that you were there for me too
Wish I was there for you
(There for you, there for you
There for you
There for you, there for you)
I wish I was there for you
(There for you, there for you
There for you
There for you, there for you)
(There for you
There for you, there for you
There for you
There for you, there for you)
I wish I was there for you
And I wish that you were there for me too
(There for you
There for you, there for you)
