I am like, begging for you baby
Makes you wanna party, wanna wake up
Baby it's violence, violence
Baby it's violence
But you can't see what I see

Cause you, ha, ha you feed off hurting me
Off hurting me, oh ha

But you can't see what I see
You can't see what I see
Cause you, ha, ha you feed off hurting me
Off hurting me, oh ha
You wanna make me bad, make me bad
(And I like it like that, and I like it like that)
You wanna pay me back, pay me back
(Said I like it like that, said I like it like that)
