Baby when it comes to love it should be mutual
I know you think that you're on fire but you're kinda cold
And I need a little more than just the usual
But you should know (What you, what you gon' do?)
You should know
When you think you've done enough
Can you love me harder?
'Cause you know I need that
Put in work and don't give up
Can you love me harder?
'Cause you know I need that

Maybe take the time to get the floor right
Maybe you can get it for the whole night
I believe in you, know that you're the truth
Here's a little insight
