I moved miles and miles to get out of your space
But I still see your smile, still on every face
And I bring all of the shit I got from you now
Whenever I move on to someone new now
I look out for your grey car, when I'm out on the road
And when I roll the paper, it's the way that you showed
And I wear all of the habits that you gave me
Right next to all the crazy that you made me
I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
But I do sometimes
I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
But you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage in my head
You made it impossible to forget
Cause you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage
See I used to be open, I was never afraid
I put all my trust in a feeling, when somebody said love I believed it
Now I wear all of the habits that you gave me
Right next to all the crazy that you made me
I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
But I do sometimes
I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
But you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage in my head
You made it impossible to forget
Cause you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage
You left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage
And you made it impossible for me to forget
And I tried
I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
But you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage in my head
You made it impossible to forget
Cause you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage
You left all your baggage
You left all your baggage
