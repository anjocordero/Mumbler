I found paradise in the trap
You know I know what to do with that
We can go anywhere on the map
Baby I'll take you to the moon and back
No bags, sunrise sippin'
Pop tags, ain't no limits
Late night sunset dippin'
Make love when we trippin'
'Cause I could have 'em all but I want you
Baby you the one, I could never want two
If we run away it's a rendezvous
Me and you
We can ride the wave, make this an endless summer
We can take our time and get to know each other
All across the world, I'll go there witchu
If we're onto something it should be each other
Let's go chase the summer
Let's go chase the summer
Let's go chase the summer
I see paradise in your eyes, ain't trippin'
Unless we got tickets to buy, big tipper
I bought another round at the bar, big triple
You're smoking like a Cuban cigar
I'm tryna get witchu baby
Let's skip, change locations
Top down in a Mercedes
Take a ride with me, yeah yeah
No bags, sunrise sippin'
Pop tags, ain't no limits
Late night sunset dippin'
Make love when we trippin'
Yeah I could have 'em all but I want you
Baby you the one, I could never want two
If we run away it's a rendezvous
Me and you
We can ride the wave, make this an endless summer
We can take our time and get to know each other
All across the world, I'll go there witchu
If we're onto something it should be each other
Let's go chase the summer
Let's go chase the summer
Let's go chase the summer
