(I'm in love)
(I'm in love)
I didn't wanna open my heart, no I didn't wanna get too deep
I knew that I'd get lost in her eyes so I stared down at my shoelaces
I took her to the car in the drive and we stared at the sky and we laughed 'til we cried
And we got so high and she stayed all night, we were young and helpless
When I wake in the morning
And I see the light
Pouring from my bedroom window
What a day, what a day, what a morning
When I realize
I was cautious but I'm guilty
I'm in love
(Love)
I wanted you to stay for the day but you left with a kiss on my cheek
I couldn't get my mind off the way that you looked in my Daft Punk T-shirt
I took a little drive in my car with a smile on my face and a hope in my heart
Maybe this is the start of a bon voyage, we were young and helpless
When I wake in the morning
And I see the light
Pouring from my bedroom window
What a day, what a day, what a morning
When I realize
I was cautious but I'm guilty
I'm in love
(Love)
Take me back
Darling, won't you take me back?
Take me, take me, take me back
Take me back
Darling, won't you take me back?
Take me, take me
We'll be Juliet and Romeo
Falling in love like dominoes
Talking all night in stereo
All night, all night
We could make love and hide away
We could take off and fly away
Tell me can we go back again
Take me, take me, take me back
Take me back
Darling, won't you take me back?
Take me, take me, take me back
Take me back
Darling, won't you take me back?
Take me, take me
Take me
I guess I'm falling helplessly
I can feel it taking over me
I guess I'm falling helplessly
