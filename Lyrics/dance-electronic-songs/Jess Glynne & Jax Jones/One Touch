(What, watcha gon' do?)
Promise me you'll catch me when I'm weightless
Hold me close before the crazy come
Until you're done with runnin', I'll be patient
'Cause I know, I know you'll be there
And I never had a plan for this
Everything is what it is
You never hold me back in anything
You didn't even have to try
I made my mind and I know, I know you'll be there
With just one touch, you take me there
Without your love, we go nowhere
With just one touch
(You're always there to remind me)
You take me there
(When water's rough you will still be there)
Without your love
(You're always there right beside me)
We go nowhere
With just one touch, with just one touch
When the tide's all out and you're neglected
It's ok if your river's running dry
Flips 180 when you least expect it
So just don't, just don't you cry
And I never had a plan for this
Everything is what it is
You never hold me back in anything
You didn't even have to try
I made my mind and I know, I know you'll be there
With just one touch, you take me there
Without your love, we go nowhere
With just one touch
(You're always there to remind me)
You take me there
(When water's rough you will still be there)
Without your love
(You're always there right beside me)
We go nowhere
With just one touch, with just one touch
Hold me tight, I'll never let you leave
Let me go, I'll live in disbelief
You say the truth, every time you speak
Without a doubt, got everything I need
Hold me tight, I'll never let you leave
Let me go, I'll live in disbelief
You say the truth, oh every time you speak, see
No doubt, got everything I need
With just one touch
(You're always there to remind me)
You take me there
(When water's rough you will still be there)
Without your love
(You're always there right beside me)
We go nowhere
With just one touch, with just one touch
(You're always there to remind me)
You take me there
(When water's rough you will still be there)
Without your love
(You're always there right beside me)
We go nowhere
With just one touch, with just one touch
