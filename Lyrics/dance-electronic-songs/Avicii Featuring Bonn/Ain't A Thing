I swear I'm losing patience
For all of these fuckin' situations
And I swear I never say shit
But this time I'm gonna say it
When the record's on the final song
And the parties will be long, long gone
All the pretenders and the hangers-on
Can go find themselves another one
But it ain't a thing, yeah, but it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby
Hey, it ain't a thing baby
I swear I'm losing patience
For all of these fuckin' altercations
Yeah and I swear I never say shit
But this time I really mean it
When the record's on the final song
And the parties will be long, long gone
All the pretenders and the hangers-on
Can go find themselves another one
But it ain't a thing, yeah, but it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby
It ain't a thing baby
It ain't a thing baby
It ain't a thing baby
But it ain't a thing, yeah, but it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby
It ain't a thing baby
But it ain't a thing, ain't a thing
It ain't a thing baby
