I don't want to be seen in this shape I'm in
I don't want you to see how depressed I've been
You were never the high one
Never wanted to die young
I don't want you to see all the scars within
So tell me why (Oh why, oh why)
Why am I such a freak?
You're out outta you mind (Oh my, oh my)
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
And I told you I'd be different
And I told you I was wild
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
I keep thinking about what we could of been
If we hadn't been caught in what should of been
Yeah, oh we used to be dancing, never cared about nothing
I don't know when we got all these scars within
So tell me why (Oh why, oh why)
Why am I such a freak?
You're out outta you mind (Oh my, oh my)
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
And I told you I'd be different
And I told you I was wild
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
Ooh yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
(Oh why, oh why)
(Oh why, oh why)
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
(Oh why, oh why)
(Oh why, oh why)
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
