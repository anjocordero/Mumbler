Walking alone and the shores are longing
I miss your footprints next to mine
Sure as the waves on the sand are washing
Your rhythm keeps my heart in time
You, you found me
Made me into something new
Lead me through the deepest waters
I promise loud to carry on for you
(You, to carry on for you, for you)
(You, to carry on for you, for you)
I'll carry on for you
Talk to the wind on the open ocean
I wonder if you hear me too?
Wrapped in my arms with every moment
The memories that pull me through
You, you found me
Made me into something new (Oh, yeah)
Lead me through the deepest waters
I promise loud to carry on to you (Woah)
(You, to carry on for you, for you)
To carry on for you
(You, to carry on for you, for you)
I'll carry on for you
You, you found me (Oh, yeah)
Made me into something new (Into something new)
Lead me through the deepest waters (Deepest)
I promise loud to carry on for you (Ooh, carry on for you)
(You, to carry on for you, for you)
(You, to carry on for you, for you)
Keep me running, keep me coming back to you
Hold me harder, love me like you know you do
Keep me running, keep me coming back to you
Hold me harder, love me like you know you do
You, you found me
Made me into something new
Lead me through the deepest waters
I promise loud to carry on for you
(You, to carry on for you, for you)
(You, to carry on for you, for you)
In the deepest waters
Ooh, I'll carry on for you
