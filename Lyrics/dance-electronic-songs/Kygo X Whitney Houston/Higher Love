(Bring me higher love)
(Bring me higher love)
Think about it
There must be a higher love
Down in the heart
Or hidden in the stars above
Without it
Life is a wasted time
Look inside your heart
And I'll look inside mine
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We walk the line and try to see
Falling behind in what could be, oh, oh
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me higher love, oh
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me higher love, oh
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me a higher love
Worlds are turning
And we're just hanging on
Facing our fear
And standing out there alone
A yearning, yeah
And it's real to me
There must be someone
Who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We walk the line and try to see
Falling behind in what could be, oh, ooh
Bring me a higher love (Oh, my love)
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love (My love)
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me higher love, oh
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me a higher love
(Bring me a higher love) Oh, bring me love
(Bring me a higher love, oh) We need a higher love
(Bring me a higher love) Bring me, bring me, yeah
(Higher love) A higher love, I keep, I'm thinking of
(Bring me a higher love) Bring me higher love, love
(Bring me a higher love) Bring me higher love, oh
(Bring me a higher love) Bring me higher love, love
(Higher love) A higher love, I keep thinking of
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
