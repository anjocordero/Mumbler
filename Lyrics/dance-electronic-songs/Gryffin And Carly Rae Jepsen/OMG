No chemical could recreate our chemistry
Got what I need, need, need
I'm technical, but I lose sensibility
When you're next to me
I feel a boom, feel a bang inside my soul, love
When you lay me down
When you do it that way, I lose control, love
Of my senses now
You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?
Like oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
(Ooh now) (Hey)
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now
I go from zero to a million when you dim the lights
You get me high, high, high
When you whisper in my ear, I hear a lullaby
So sing to me all night
I feel the boom, feel the bang from head to toe, love
When you caress me down
When you do it that way, I lose control, love
You know you got me now
You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?
Like oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
(Ooh now) (Hey)
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now
You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?
And when you're gone, you should know that you're all that I'm wanting
And I'll always be feeling the same
Like oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you, ah
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God
I think I might love you
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
I think I might love you (I think I might love you)
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now
