It's sad we're not together, but I wish happiness for you
I know we said forever, love don't always make it through
Sometimes even the good things get lost along the way
We opened up the same book, we found a different page
Cause honestly your loyalties, insecurities and priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
Cause honestly your loyalties, insecurities and priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I hope that you remember, that I was always good to you
And even though you hurt me ah, I just had to see it through
Sometimes even the good things get lost along the way
I had to let you go but, I wanted you to stay
Cause honestly your loyalties, insecurities and priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wish you well, I wish you well
Cause honestly your loyalties, insecurities and priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well
Wish you well I, wish you well I
Wish you well I, wish you well I
I wish you well I, wish you well I
Wish you well I
I wish you well
I wish you well, oh oh
I wish, I wish
