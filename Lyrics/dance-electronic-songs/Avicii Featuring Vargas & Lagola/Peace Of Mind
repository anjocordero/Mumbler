Dear society
You are moving way too fast
Way too fast for me
I'm just tryna catch my breath
Can I get a little peace of mind?
And a little bit of silence to unwind
Relieve, do you need a relieve, do you need a relieve?
Do you need a release, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be, can I get a little peace of mind?

Relieve, do you need a relieve, do you need a relieve?
Do you need a release, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be, do you wanna let let go?
Do you wanna let go, do you let go?
Do you wanna let go, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be, can I get a little peace of mind?
And a little bit of silence to unwind
