You walked away, you left me out here on the floor
You didn't care, you're still the one that I adore
You gave me something like nobody did before
Oh whoa, oh whoa
If I close my eyes, all I see
Is you standing there in front of me
You're on my mind, constantly
Now I can't get no sleep
All day all night you keep me up
Non-stop
I'm so done, yeah
I'm giving you more than enough
Of my love
I'm so done, yeah
I blame myself, I broke my own heart loving you
You cut me up and now I'm bleeding from the truth
You left me helpless, now I don't know what to do
Oh whoa, oh whoa
If I close my eyes, all I see
Is you standing there in front of me
You're on my mind, constantly
Now I can't get no sleep
All day all night you keep me up
Non-stop
I'm so done, yeah
I'm giving you more than enough
Of my love
I'm so done, yeah
No sleep, nah nah nah na
No sleep, nah nah nah na
I think about you day and night
Now I can't get no
No sleep, nah nah nah na
No sleep, nah nah nah na
I think about you day and night
Now I can't get no
No, no, no
No sleep tonight
No, no, no
No sleep tonight
All day all night you keep me up
Non-stop
I'm so done, yeah
I'm giving you more than enough
Of my love
I'm so done, yeah
All day all night you keep me up
Non-stop
I'm so done, yeah
I'm giving you more than enough
Of my love
I'm so done, yeah
