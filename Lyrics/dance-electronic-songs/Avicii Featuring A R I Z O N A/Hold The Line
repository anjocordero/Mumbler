Crossbows and arrows
The smoke in the shadows
You'll lose your mind
Standing on the battle line
Starting to choke on
Your heart in your throat and it feels just like
You can't remember how to fight
We'll crack before we shatter
We can't fall apart
We don't get to die young
Trouble keeping our head sometimes
We just have to push on
We don't get to give up this life
All the breath in your lungs
Is stronger than the tears in your eyes
It's do or die, we're alive
And while we're here
Hold the line
Hold the line
Don't hold your hands up it's your final stand off
Put your white flag down
Oh don't you surrender now
No hero's story
There's no blaze of glory
But dawn only comes
At the end of the night
We'll crack before we shatter
We can't fall apart
We don't get to die young
Trouble keeping our head sometimes
We just have to push on
We don't get to give up this life
All the breath in your lungs
Is stronger than the tears in your eyes
It's do or die but we're alive
And while we're here
Hold the line
Hold the line
Hold the line
We don't get to die young
We just have to push on
We don't get to die young
Hold the line
