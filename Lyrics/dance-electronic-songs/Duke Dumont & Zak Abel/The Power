You do me, I do you
Feed me lies, I'ma find the truth
Feel the lie, numb the pain
Kiss the sky, I'ma make it rain
Getting close, breaking through
Confidence looks good on you
Feel the lie, numb the pain
Kiss the sky, I'ma make it rain
I can feel the power
Runnin' through my veins
Gettin' louder
Callin' out my name
And it feels like sunlight in the night sky
It shines on my mind
(Oh, it shines on my mind)
You do me, I do you

(Oh, it shines on my mind)
I can feel it, yeah
I can feel it, yeah
I can feel the power
Gettin' louder
I can feel the power (I can feel it)
Gettin' louder
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey, hey yeah, hey)
(I can feel, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(I can feel, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(I can feel, hey yeah, hey)
