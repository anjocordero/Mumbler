[Future:]
Yeah, Pluto
Lemme do my dance in this bitch, don't get case closed
Made a hunnid bands off the brick
Made a hunnid bands off the brick, pure yayo
Send my girl to church with some drug money
Told her pay for college, there's some bills coming
[FKA twigs:]
Day one, take me to my favourite show
Day two, hold my hand and pull me close
Next to me, kiss my cheek
Just any day, yes
Day three, take me to a deep river
Steal a kiss when I'm lost in the mist
Will you still be there for me
Once I'm yours to obtain?
Once my fruits are for taking
And you flow through my veins?
Do you still think I'm beautiful
When my tears fall like rain?
My love is so bountiful
For a man who is true to me
[FKA twigs & (Future):]
For a man who can follow his heart
Not get bound by his boys and his chains
For a man who can follow his heart
And stand up in my holy terrain (I try, I try, I try, I try for you)
[FKA twigs:]
I'm blue when the Moon hits my skin right
Hot pink when you open up my sweet thighs
Pull you in, and your life can begin, 'cause it's early days
Will you still be there for me
Now I'm yours to obtain?
Now my fruits are for taking
And your fingers are stained?
Do you still think I'm beautiful
When you light me in flames?
My love is so bountiful
[FKA twigs & (Future):]
For a man who can follow his heart (I try, I try)
Not get bound by his boys and his chains (I try, I try, I try for you)
For a man who can follow his heart (I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry)
And stand up in my holy terrain (I try, I try, I try, I try for you)
[Future:]
Throw loads of gold on you just to fall asleep, yeah
I hope you never take my love, yeah, in vain, yeah
Through the thunder, through the window I see rain (I see rain)
Water this garden, play with snakes in Balmain (Oh yeah)
Making you fall apart, watch me drown in my pain (My pain)
I feed you poison, forever my lady (Oh baby)
Throw loads of gold on you just to fall asleep, babe (Fall asleep)
Pray for my sins, make me stronger where I'm weak, yeah (Pray for)
We die, we die together, the prophecy complete, yeah (Prophecy)
We gettin' high, we touch the sky until we deceased, yeah (Deceased)
And if you pray for me, I know you play for keeps, yeah (Play for keeps)
Calling my name, calling my name (Calling my name)
Taking the feeling of Promethazine away (Take it)
[FKA twigs & Future:]
For a man who can follow his heart (I try, I try, I try, I try)
Not get bound by his boys and his chains (I try, I try, I try for you)
For a man who can follow his heart (I try, I try, I try, I try)
And stand up in my holy terrain (I try, I try, I try, I try for you)
[Future:]
I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry
