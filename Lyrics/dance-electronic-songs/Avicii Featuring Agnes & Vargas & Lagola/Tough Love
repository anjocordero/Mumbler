Weight is on me
Weight is on you
We scream and we fight like there's nothing to lose
End of the day
Come and take my arm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Weight is on you
Weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try
We stumble and we fall
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Give me tough love
And a lesson to learn
Your tough love
Is what I deserve
Sweet tough love
You're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Weight is on you
Weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try
We stumble and we fall
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Give me tough love
And a lesson to learn
Your tough love
Is what I deserve
Sweet tough love
You're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Give me tough love
And a lesson to learn
Your tough love
Is what I deserve
Sweet tough love
You're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
