You bring an energy I've never felt before
Some kind of chemical that reaches to my core
Feels like, as far as you and me, I've never had a choice
You feel like home, mmm
You're like the opposite of all of my mistakes
Tear down the biggest walls and put me in my place
I know that kind of comfortable you cannot replicate
You feel like home, mmm
So if you're asking me
Sayin', "Oh, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart
No, I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul
That's how you know
That's how I know
I feel it in my bones
And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul
That's how you know
That's how I know
I feel it in my bones
So many people just walk in and out your life
I'd trade a couple hundred just to get some time back, that's right
'Cause for you and me I got no alibi
You feel like home, oh
So if you're asking me
Sayin', "Oh, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart
No, I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul
That's how you know
That's how I know
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
That's how you know
That's how I know
So if you're asking me
Sayin', "Boy, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart
No, I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul
That's how you know
That's how I know
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
That's how you know
That's how I know
I feel it in my bones
