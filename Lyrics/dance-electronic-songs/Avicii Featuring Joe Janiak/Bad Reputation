Can you see my emotions
Sinking away in slow motion
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea
Can you see my emotions?
Say can you see my devotion?
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea
I hear what you're saying
I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying
For a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me I know
I got a bad reputation
I know that you been talking
You never see me sleepwalking
Drifting out into nothing
Rolling away in my dreams
Can you feel that I'm falling?
Laying awake til the morning
Every word that I'm calling
Just getting lost at sea
I hear what you're saying
I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying
For a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me I know
I got a bad reputation
I got a bad reputation
So, you got me figured out
Know what I'm all about
I'm all about dollars and green
Don't care 'bout nothing but me
You got me figured out
Know what I'm all about
Don't care 'bout nothing but me, yeah
I hear what you're saying
I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying
For a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me I know
I got a bad reputation
I got a bad reputation
