Wait, don't speak
Don't wanna hear all your warnings
Don't care what happened before me
Wait, don't leave
Nothing that's easy is worth it
And nothing that's worth it is perfect, yeah
I been thinking to myself, to myself
I want you all to myself, no one else
Even if it gives me hell, baby
I would take it all for ya
If you're gonna hurt someone, then let it be me
If you're gonna break my heart, I'm ready to bleed
Even if it kills me, oh, I'm begging you, please
If you're gonna hurt someone, then let it be me
Oh, let it be me
(Oh, let it be me)
Oh, let it be me
(Oh, let it be me) Let...
Oh, let it be me
Let it, let it be me
Oh, let it be me
Let it, let it be me
Oh, let it be me
If we fall
Then you can blame it all on me
Don't have to tell me you're sorry
It's your call
Whether you leave or you take me
I'm still gonna want you like crazy, yeah
I've been thinking to myself, to myself
I want you all to myself, no one else
Even if it gives me hell, baby
I would take it all for ya
If you're gonna hurt someone, then let it be me
If you're gonna break my heart, I'm ready to bleed
Even if it kills me, oh, I'm begging you, please
If you're gonna hurt someone, then let it be me
Oh, let it be me
(Oh, let it be me)
Oh, let it be me
(Oh, let it be me) Let...
Oh, let it be me
Let it, let it be me
Oh, let it be me
Let it, let it be me
Oh, let it be me
I been thinking to myself
I want you and no one else, oh-whoa
Even if it gives me hell, baby
