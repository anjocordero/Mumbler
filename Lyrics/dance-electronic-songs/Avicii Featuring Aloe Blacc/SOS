Can you hear me, S.O.S.?
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow
I can feel your love pulling me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to creep
I'd let go but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need you now
I can feel your love pulling me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers (Part time lovers)
(Yeah, more than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers
Can you hear me, S.O.S.?
Help me put my mind to rest
