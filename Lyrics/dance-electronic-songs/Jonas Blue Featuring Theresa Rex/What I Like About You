All my life, I've been a good girl tryna do what's right
Never told no lies
Then you came around and suddenly my world turned upside down
Now there's no way out
I tried to fight against it
Shut out what all my friends said
Can't get you out of my head
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa whoa
I keep letting you in
Though I know it's not a good thing
I got you under my skin
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
You're so outta line
You make me bad and I don't know why
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya
I'm out of my mind
You got me runnin' all the red lights
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, that's what I like about ya)
(Ooh, yeah, that's what I like about ya)
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, that's what I like about ya)
(Ooh, yeah, that's what I like about ya)
I don't care if my daddy don't think we're the perfect pair
It's my affair
Yeah I don't know why my momma worries when I'm out all night
She thinks I'm 9, uh-uh
I tried to fight against it
Shut out what all my friends said
Can't get you out of my head
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa whoa
I keep letting you in
Though I know it's not a good thing
I got you under my skin
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
You're so outta line
You make me bad and I don't know why
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya
I'm out of my mind
You got me runnin' all the red lights
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, that's what I like about ya)

(Ooh, yeah, that's what I like about ya)
Ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, ooh
For you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
I tried to fight against it
Shut out what all my friends said
Can't get you out of my head (Out of my head, out of my head)
I keep letting you in
Though I know it's not a good thing
I got you under my skin
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
You're so outta line (You're so outta line)
You make me bad and I don't know why (I don't know why)
But that's what I like about ya
