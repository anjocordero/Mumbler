All of the troubled times that we have overcome
All of the trials to find somewhere that we belong
All I know is that with you I'm holding on
'Cause all of the days are
All of the days are on the run
Don't you love it how it all just fades away?
When your clothes don't feel the songs of yesterday
And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it how it all
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
All of the tracks we traced we raced to reach the sun
All of the lives to find a place where we belong
All I know is that with you I'm moving on
'Cause all of the days are
All of the days are on the run
And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it how it all
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it how it all
It all just fades away
