All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
Tell me what's going on
Can you take me there?
Before the morning comes
Can you make me care?
Tell me what's going on
Help me fade into flashing lights
Yeah I've been working overtime
'Cause all my friends
They know
Been making messes out of silence
If we're the same
Let me go
Somebody save me from the madness
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear-
Come watch us rise again
And out of the fever
Life will never be the same
And I'm a believer
Don't call us another name
We were born to the same sunrise
It's getting brighter all the time
'Cause all my friends
They know
Been making messes out of silence
If we're the same
Let me go
Somebody save me from the madness
(Right)
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
(Yeah, yeah)
'Cause all my friends
They know
Been making messes out of silence
If we're the same
Let me go
Somebody save me from the madness
(Madness, madness, mad, mad, mad-)
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching
I can hear them talking
