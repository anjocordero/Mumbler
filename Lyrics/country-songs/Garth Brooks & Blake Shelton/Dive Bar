Well turn that bottle up and drank it crank that jukebox up and Hank it, Bartender, pour another round
Here's to our best man decision situation no conditions oh and memories we all need to drown
So fill your cup and raise it up, jump in and join the club and float this Whisky River reservoir
Well come and spend the weekend, in the deep end, of a dive bar
'Cuz up in here you're not the only lovin' left girl lost and lonely one who's ever swam against the tide
Thinkin' this is your oasis it's the safest of the places that a broken heart can find to hide
So here's a toast coast-to-coast, with a big ol' adios to wishes wasted on them fallin' stars
We're gonna spend the weekend, in the deep end, of The Dive Bar
Yeah it's just chapter after chapter, of happy never after 'cuz that's just the way the story goes
For some bar stool believers wear our heart out on our sleevers, just goin' where the neon glows
Yeah it's just chapter after chapter, of happy never after though that's just the way the story goes
Yeah we're just never quite belongers hanger-oners way too longers, just buzzin' where the neon glows
Problems if y'all got 'em let 'em sink down to the bottom doesn't matter who or where you are
Gonna spend the weekend, in the deep end, the water's fine, y'all so just come on in
In the deep end, of The Dive Bar
Of this dive bar
We're talkin' about a dive bar
