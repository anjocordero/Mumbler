Still got your number in my phone.
And even though you don't know I listen
I still call and wait 'til the tone
Just to hear you saying, "Leave a message."
Since you've been gone I've had to find
Different ways to grieve.
There's days that I don't even want it on my mind,
But tonight I'm weak.
So, I'm gonna pull out pictures, ones with you in 'em,
Laugh and cry a little while reminiscing
By myself.
I can't help
That all I think about is
How you were taken way too soon.
It ain't the same here without you.
I gotta say, missin' you comes in waves,
And tonight I'm drowning.
Yeah, I know you're in a better place,
And one day I'll see you again,
But it's killing me we can't be face to face.
I miss my best friend.
So, tonight I'm gonna pull out pictures, ones with you in 'em,
Laugh and cry a little while reminiscing
By myself.
I can't help
That all I think about is
How you were taken way too soon.
It ain't the same here without you.
I gotta say, missin' you comes in waves,
And tonight I'm drowning.
Yeah, tonight I'm drowning.
I know it's a part of life,
But I wasn't ready to say goodbye.
So, tonight I'm gonna pull out pictures, ones with you in 'em,
Laugh and cry a little while reminiscing
By myself.
I can't help
That all I think about is
How you were taken way too soon.
It ain't the same here without you.
I gotta say, missin' you comes in waves,
And tonight I'm drowning.
Yeah, tonight I'm drowning.
