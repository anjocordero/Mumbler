Just look at her sitting there
Sweatpants, t-shirt, and a comfy chair, hm
Her hair in a bun, one hand on a mug
And the other one's playing snare
To a George Strait vinyl, that yes-or-no line'll
Get her close but I don't think she can understand
Just how far I've been letting my heart fall
Or what's in my head
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we'd go to get tanned
Bet we'd take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little something like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand
She don't know I got some big, big plans
(She don't know, well she don't know)
She don't know I got some big, big plans
(She don't know, well she don't know)
She don't know, I already bought a ring
Hid it in the bottom left drawer right beside the sink
A shiny emerald diamond on a brand-new band
Asked her mama for permission and her daddy for her hand
I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we'd go to get tanned
Bet we'd take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little something like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand
She don't know I got some big, big plans
(She don't know, well she don't know)
She don't know I got some big, big plans
(She don't know, well she don't know)
Well here I go
'Cause right now we're back in her home town
And I'm down on one knee
I guess she finally figured out
I'm gonna ask her to marry me
I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we'd go to get tanned
Bet we'd take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little something like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand
She don't know I got some big, big plans
(She don't know, well she don't know)
She don't know I got some big, big plans
(She don't know, well she don't know)
