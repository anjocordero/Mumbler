Hey, mamma, how do you get a red-wine stain out of your favorite dress?
Black mascara off a pillow case
Cure a one-too-many headache
Mamma, can I come and maybe stay a few days?
This weekend or next
And hey, how do you get a red-wine stain out of your favorite dress?
How does he sleep at night?
Mamma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mamma, can you die from a broken heart?
Can you ask daddy if he's got time to come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything and keep that pistol in the drawer
Mamma, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away
How does he sleep at night?
Mamma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mamma, can you die from a broken heart?
Oh, broken heart
Can your knees give out from praying so hard?
Can you go blind from crying in the dark?
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?
How does he sleep at night?
Mamma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
How does he sleep at night?
Mamma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mamma, can you die from a broken heart?
A broken heart
