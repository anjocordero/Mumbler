Hometown hero at the bar
Burned out high life superstar, you know
Kept the buzz to fill the hole
Love the lights, stole the show
Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground
It's been a long time coming
Couldn't keep on running
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin'
With the path you're choosin'
And it's time to let go
Of someone that I used to know
Of someone that I used to know
Rides a high that tears him down
Hates himself and loves a crowd
The king of fools, a heavy crown
Didn't know he almost drown
Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground
It's been a long time coming
Couldn't keep on running
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin'
With the path you're choosin'
And it's time to let go
Of someone that I used to know
Know, know
Know, know
It's been a long time coming
Couldn't keep on running
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin'
With the path you're choosin'
And it's time to let go
Of someone that I used to
Someone that I used to know
Know
Know
Know
Ooh
Know
Know
Know
Know
Know
Know
Know
Know
