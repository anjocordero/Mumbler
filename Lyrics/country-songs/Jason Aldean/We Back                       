Where's the guy in the steel toes, covered in dirt
Just a Rock N Roll T-shirt, headed to work
With a pack of Red Man in his pocket
He's kinda red, man, but he's rockin'
Wears a beat up Tele' and Marshall stack
Little Marshall Tucker and a six pack
Where's the good ole boys and the good ole days
Straight up getting sideways
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my momma said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong
Now it's on, we back
Where's the chick wearing blue jeans a little too tight?
Got a grip on koozie if it what she likes
Getting picked up in a pick-up
And kicking it with guys like us
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my momma said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong
Now it's on, we back
Sun comes up and sun goes down
Yeah, everything good comes back around
We back!
We back!
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my momma said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong
Now it's on, we back
(We back, we back!)
Thought we were gone but you're wrong (In your speakers)
Now it's on, we back
(We back, we back!)
(It's probably true what my momma said)
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong
Now it's on, we back
