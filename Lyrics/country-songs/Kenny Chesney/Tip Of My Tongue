I love the dimples in the small of your back
The way they're speaking to me just like that
Red wine made my imagination run
Oh I can taste it on the tip of my tongue
Let it run, let it roll
Baby I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang onto anything you can hold
It's a long way down
To where I wanna go
It's a long way down
To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar
On the tip of my tongue
Girl, believe me when I say it's true
Nobody makes me feel the way you do
Well I love you from the morning till the setting sun, yeah
I can taste the ocean on the tip of my tongue
Let it run, let it roll
Baby I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang onto anything you can hold
It's a long way down
To where I wanna go
It's a long way down
To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar
On the tip of my tongue
Yeah I love your salt and sugar
On the tip of my tongue
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar
On the tip of my tongue
Yeah I love your salt and sugar
On the tip of my tongue
I wanna love you till my days are done
I wanna tell you that I think that you're the one
Oh, girl, you know when it's all said and done
Everything about you's on the tip of my tongue
