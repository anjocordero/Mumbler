We were just a couple years short of the age by my name on a fake ID
And still, 'bout a hundred away from the day your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line-steppers who just couldn't wait to step over the line
Never thinking we wouldn't last, I was your first and you were mine
And we were leather jackets, hangin' on to a Harley, two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were, both feet hanging out over the edge of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter, though a part of me is always gonna miss it
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
We were gonna make it work, little baby had it all laid out in her mind
By the time we knew time was running out we'd done run out of time
But we were downtown Saturday night, last call, cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade like the stamp on the back of her hand
We were, her on my shoulders, lighter in the air, pour some sugar on me
We were a top town in Johnson's field when she whispered that she wants me
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter, though a part of me is always gonna miss it
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
We were leather jackets, hangin' on to a Harley, two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were, both feet hanging out over the edge of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter, though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Yes, I do
Friends say "Oh well, let that ship sail, you've gotta let go of her"
Just wasn't meant to be, but somewhere down deep I still believe that we were
