We got a pontoon boat with a Yamaha
People dressed like they're in Panama
Small town, spring break
Every weekend 'round this place
And there's a bunch of boys tryna catch the eyes
Of all the pretty girls that are walking by
Those redneck margaritas
Are two for one at that old marina
Tan lines and gas-station cheap sunglasses
They're coming here from all around
To get a little southbound, unwound
Tennessee-Honey kinda buzz
Then south sounds up loud
Summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the party cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down
Yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah
Moe got a ticket in a no-wake zone
But Katie's the one that should take it slow
'Cause she's dancin' on the dock
And it's only two o'clock
Yeah, the fish ain't bitin' 'cause the party's on
The old men are thinkin' 'bout goin' home
But those redneck margaritas
Are two for one at that old marina
Yeah
We're gonna get a little southbound, unwound
Tennessee-Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud
Summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the party cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down
Yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Come look
Woo
Yeah, we got the roof swing swingin' like a chandelier
Little bit of heaven on the water right here
Don't need much, just a couple of beers
And you and me gotta love this time of year
And getting southbound, southbound
So let's get a little southbound, unwound
Tennessee-Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud
Summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the party cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Let's get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah
