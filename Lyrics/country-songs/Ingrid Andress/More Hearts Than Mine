I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearin' all the stories
I've been tellin' you for six months now
We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road
If I bring you home to momma,
I guess I better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice
And take you fishin' but pretend that he don't like you
If we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breakin' more hearts than mine
My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high-school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't out live
So, if I bring you home to momma,
I guess I better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice
And buy you dinner but pretend that he don't like you
If we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breakin' more hearts than mine
If I bring you home to momma,
I guess I better warn ya
She feels every heart ache I go through
And if my dad sees me crying'
He'll pour some whiskey over ice
And tell a lie and say he never really liked you
If we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breakin' more hearts than mine
You'll be breakin' more hearts than mine
