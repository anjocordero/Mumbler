(There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing) (Oh, ooh)
(There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing gonna shake)
Sister smoked all the Camels in the county last week
She cleaned out the 7-Eleven, sneakin' in, smellin' like nicotine
Mama's burning chicken for the Tupperware party tonight
Daddy's asleep in his chair, the TV's blaring the stats for half time
(Whoa, whoa, oh, oh)
Well, life can get real funny
(Whoa, whoa, oh, oh)
We got more love than we got money
Some swing a little higher, some'll just hang low
A few of us are on fire to get out, and some just wanna stay home
But it don't matter, 'cause the roots run deep
And ain't nothing gonna shake our family tree
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
(Ba la la bum, ba la la, da)
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Gramma sold her Maytag dryer to post my uncle's bail
He'll be hanging her laundry till there's a snow storm in hell
Me and my cousins, like to take a Sunday drive
And roll one up before pot luck lunch and get high school high
(Whoa, whoa, oh, oh)
Well, life can get real funny
(Whoa, whoa, oh, oh)
We got more love than we got money
Some swing a little higher, some'll just hang low
A few of us are on fire to get out, and some just wanna stay home
But it don't matter, 'cause the roots run deep
And ain't nothing gonna shake our family tree
And ain't nothing gonna shake our family tree, ooh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
(Ba la la bum, ba la la, da)
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Some of us got problems, but everybody's alright
Some of us got big plans, some are just plannin' on gettin' by
Some of us got problems, but they love us anyway
Through thick and thin, hell, we're still kin at the end of the day
Some swing a little higher, some'll just hang low
A few of us are on fire to get out, and some just wanna stay home
But it don't matter, 'cause the roots run deep
And ain't nothing gonna shake our family tree
And ain't nothing gonna shake our family tree
Oh, whoa, life can get real funny
Ooh, we got more love than we got money
(And ain't nothing gonna shake our family tree) You don't make it, ooh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh (oh the roots run deep)
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing gonna shake
(And ain't nothing gonna shake our family tree) Our family tree
