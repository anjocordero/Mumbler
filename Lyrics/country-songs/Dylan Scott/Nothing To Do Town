It ain't New York City
And it ain't L.A.
We ain't got no rooftop bars
Like they do on Broadway
It's just a little town square middle of nowhere
Ain't even big enough to be a map dot
We ain't got a lot but we sure do a lot
With the little bit that we got
We got a little something, something we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high
With your girl and your boys by the fire making noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some George Strait songs that we turn up loud
Living it up til the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothing to do, who said there's nothing to do
Who said there's nothing to do in this nothing to do town
Yeah our way of living, no it ain't complicated
Don't knock it til you try it, yeah you might not hate it
Around here we work and we play, cuss and we pray
And at the end of a long hard day
We got a little something, something we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high
With your girl and your boys by the fire making noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some Brooks and Dunn songs that we turn up loud
Living it up til the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothing to do, who said there's nothing to do
Who said there's nothing to do in this nothing to do town
It's just a little town square middle of nowhere
Ain't even big enough to be a map dot
We ain't got a lot but we sure do a lot
With the little bit that we got
We got a little something, something we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high
With your girl and your boys by the fire making noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some Tim McGraw songs that we turn up loud
Living it up til the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothing to do, who said there's nothing to do
Who said there's nothing to do in this nothing to do town
In this nothing to do town
