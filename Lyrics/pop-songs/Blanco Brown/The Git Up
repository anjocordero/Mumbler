Right now
I just need you to get real loose
Get comfortable
Grab your loved ones or grab your love partner
And if you're by yourself no worries
Just follow after me
Gon' and do the 2 step then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it (Woooo Whoooo Whoooooouuu)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Gon' throw down take a sip with it
And lean back put your hips in it (Woooo Whoooo Whoooooouuu)
Let's have some fun
To the left to the left now (To the left, to the left)
To the right to the right (To the right)
Now take your left hand and put it on your side (Put it on your side)
Gon' roll your shoulders (Roll your shoulders)
Do the slip and slide (Do the slip and slide)
This next part's my favorite part 'cause it's time to shine
Gon' and do the 2 step then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it (Woooo Whoooo Whoooooouuu)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Gon' throw down take a sip with it
And lean back put your hips in it (It's simple, you can do it)
Slide to the left (Left), slide to the right (Right)
Now cool down, have a good time
Slide to the left (Left), slide to the right (Right)
Do the butterfly have a good time
Round, round, round and round you go
It's time to show out right now and take to the floor
Gon' and do the 2 step then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it (Woooo Whoooo Whooooo Ouuu)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Gon' throw down take a sip with it
And lean back put your hips in it (Woooo Whoooo Whooooouuu)
