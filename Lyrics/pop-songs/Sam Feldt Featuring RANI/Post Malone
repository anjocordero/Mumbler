One more drink, got one more Bacardi
One more dance at this afterparty
We're still going, going strong
Speed so fast, like a Ferrari
We get wild, like on safari
We're still going, going strong
And all of these good things, good things, good things
All we need, good things, good things, good things
Tonight we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-oh-oh
Yeah we are never ever going home
Tonight, ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-oh-oh
Yeah we are never ever going home
Yeah we are never ever going home
Yeah we are never ever going home
See the ocean there in your eyes
In slow motion, we see the sunrise
We are, we are in the zone
5 AM and we still are rolling
In the deepest of my emotions
We are, we are in the zone
And all of these good things, good things, good things
All we need, good things, good things, good things
Tonight we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-oh-oh
Yeah we are never ever going home
Tonight, ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-oh-oh
Yeah we are never ever going home
Yeah we are never ever going home
Yeah we are never ever going home
Tonight we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-oh-oh
Yeah we are never ever going home
Tonight, ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-oh-oh
Yeah we are never ever going home
Yeah we are never ever going home
Yeah we are never ever going home
