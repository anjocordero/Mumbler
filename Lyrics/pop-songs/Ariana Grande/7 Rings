Yeah
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things
Yeah
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with cuffs and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing
My wrist, stop watchin'
My neck is flossin'
Make big deposits
My gloss is poppin'
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
Wearin' a ring but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all 'em."
Happiness is the same price as "red-bottoms"
My smile is beamin'
My skin is gleamin'
The way it shine
I know you've seen it
You've seen it
I bought a crib
Just for the closet
Both his and hers
I want it, I got it
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Baby
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
Oh, yeah
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yep
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black Card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag
But I be like, "Put it in the bag."
Yeah
When you see them racks
They stacked up like my ass
Yeah
Shoot
Go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop
Gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothin' but net when we shoot
Look at my neck
Look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it then that's what I get
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Oh, yeah, yeah
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
