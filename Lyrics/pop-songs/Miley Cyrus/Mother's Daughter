Hallelujah, I'm a freak, I'm a freak
Hallelujah, every day of the week
I'm 'a do ya, like I want ya
I'm a Nile crocodile, a piranha
Oh my God, she got the power
Oh look at her, she got the power
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water
Or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water
Or that I'm my mother's daughter
So back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh hey
Hallelujah, I'm a witch, I'm a witch
Hallelujah, swish, swish
I'm a three point shooter
I blow through ya
Like a hot wind out in the bayou, yeah
Oh my God, she got the power
Whoa look at her, she got the power
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water
Or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water
Or that I'm my mother's daughter
So back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
My mama always told me that I'd make it
That I'd make it, so I made it
I put my back into it, my heart in it
So I did it, yeah I did it
My mama always told me that I'd make it
That I'd make it, so I made it
I put my back into it, my heart in it
So I did it, yeah I did it
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water
Or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Swish swish, motherfucker
