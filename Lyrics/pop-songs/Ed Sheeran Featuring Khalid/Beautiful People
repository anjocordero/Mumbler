We are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sun down and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're heading downtown
('Round here)
Everybody's looking for a come-up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I'm love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation, here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become
Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
(L.A., mm)
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere
(Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there
(All night)
I'm not fazed by all the lights and flashing cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
We don't fit in well
We are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become
Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
