Don't speak, no, don't try
It's been a secret for the longest time
Don't run, huh, no don't hide
Been running from it for the longest time
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind
Right now I'm shameless
Screaming my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
It's all there, now it's real
Now that you have me, do you want me still?
My kisses are history they go back a long time
Uh, and I'm tired of loving
somebody that's not mine
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind
Right now I'm shameless
Screaming my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
Distance, inches in between us
I want you to give in
I want you to give in
Weakness, tension in between us
I just wanna give in
And I don't care if I'm forgiven
Right now I'm shameless
Screaming my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don’t wanna do this now)
