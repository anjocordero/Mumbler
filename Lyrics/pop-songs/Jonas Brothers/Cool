I'm feeling so cool
From top to the bottom, just cool
In every little thing that I do
Dammit I'm feeling so cool, yeah
Woke up feeling like a new James Dean
I combed my hair like and old school scene
Feeling high like that late night summer of last year, yeah
Standing there with the red dress on, yeah
A killer queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me or am I just having a good year?
Lately I've been feeling so cool
From top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Dammit I'm feeling so cool
It's like ooh, maybe I should bottle my moves
Sell it for a dollar or two
Dammit I'm feeling so cool
Must have done something right
'Cause all these lights are green
Man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh I feel like Post Malone
When I get home
Sitting there winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it
How complicated was last year
Lately I've been feeling so cool
From top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Dammit I'm feeling so cool
It's like ooh, maybe I should bottle my moves
Sell it for a dollar or two
'Cause dammit I'm feeling so cool
Woke up feeling like a new James Dean
I combed my hair like and old school scene
When I grow up I wanna be just like me
Lately I've been feeling so cool
From top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Dammit I'm feeling so cool
It's like ooh, maybe I should bottle my moves
Sell it for a dollar or two
'Cause dammit I'm feeling so cool
