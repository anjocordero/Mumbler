In every room I'm walking into, yeah
We started off innocent
'Til I got pulled right into your issue, yeah
I'm tired of sending hugs and kisses, oh

I was really rooting for you, yeah

It's like damn
Why you gotta be so cold in the summertime, summertime?
I was really rooting for you
We was really rooting for you, yeah yeah yeah
Now I see you're having so much fun with everyone
You had so much fun making fun of
Did you go and bump your head?
Did you forget where you came from?
