I met her on a Monday evening
She was standing outside of the Park and Ride
And I said, "Hey Ma, where you been?
Been looking for a woman like you for all my life"
And she said, "Hola, talk to me
Before I have to leave"
And one day we could be
Maybe more than two lost souls just passing by
Knew I was falling when I looked inside your eyes
She said, "I know you are but what am I?"
Tell me have you seen a sunset
Turn into a sunrise, kiss right through the night
'Cause we should try that sometime
Hold you till the morning, and if I said, "I'm falling"
Would you just reply
"I know you are but what am I?"
What am I?
What am I?
Open the door to my apartment
We get in
Kissin' on my neck and throwin' my jacket to the side
I know your heart is beating quick
And if you put your head on my chest
Hear the same in mine
And we'll be making love
Until the sun comes up
But one day, maybe I
I could put a ring on your finger
Before you change your mind, yeah
Knew I was falling when I looked inside your eyes
She said, "I know you are but what am I?"
Tell me have you seen a sunset
Turn into a sunrise, kiss right through the night
'Cause we should try that sometime
Hold you till the morning, and if I said, "I'm falling"
Would you just reply
"I know you are but what am I?"
What am I?
What am I?
What am I?
Tell me have you seen a sunset
Turn into a sunrise, kiss right through the night
'Cause we should try that sometime
Hold you till the morning, and if I said, "I'm falling"
Would you just reply
"I know you are but what am I?"
Tell me have you seen a sunset
Turn into a sunrise, kiss right through the night
'Cause we should try that sometime
Hold you till the morning, and if I said, "I'm falling"
Would you just reply
"I know you are but what am I?"
