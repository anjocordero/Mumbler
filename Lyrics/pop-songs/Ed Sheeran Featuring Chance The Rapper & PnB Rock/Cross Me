[PnB Rock:]
Anything she needs, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, dawg that's all me
Just know if you cross her then you cross me
Cross me, cross me
If you, if you, if you, if you
(It's Fred again)
Anything she needs, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, dawg that's all me
Just know if you cross her then you cross me
Cross me, cross me
If you, if you
[Ed Sheeran:]
And she ain't messin' with no other man
Me and her have something different
I really need all you to understand
That nobody's coming close
And I don't ever wanna run around
I spent my youth jumping in and out
You know I fuckin' love her now
Like nobody ever could
And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh no
I'm stickin' with my baby for sure
Together or solo
It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no
So if you hear about my lady, just know
That she ain't the one to play with, oh no
And I'll be standing so close
So you know that, hey
[PnB Rock:]
Anything she needs, she can call me

[Ed Sheeran (PnB Rock):]
If you cross her
Then you cross me (Cross me)

And I think that you should know
That if you cross her

Then you cross me
(Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, dawg that's all me)
So come on and let it go
Oh I think that you should know
[Chance the Rapper:]
And she ain't messin' with no other man
Now what you not gon' do
Is stand there across from me
Like you got Kung Fu
Death stare, crossed arms
Running your mouth like a faucet
But you don't know that my girl been doin' CrossFit
Boom! Kung Pow! Hit your ass with a cross kick
Pullin' air out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a little blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit
Ay, no one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the H.B.I.C
Couple of things that you need to know
If you still wanna be friends with me
[PnB Rock:]
Just know if you cross her then you cross me
Cross me, cross me
If you, if you, if you, if you cross her
