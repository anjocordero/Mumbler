Imma break you off, let me be your motivation
To stay and give it tonight
And, baby, turn around, let me give you innovation
Hey, 'cause I do it so right
You got that good good, baby, don't you?
Got that good good, baby, don't you?
But you leavin' solo
Ain't regular, that ain't regular
I ain't gon' keep, keep fightin' for it
Ain't gon' keep, keep fightin' for it
'Cause you know this thing here
Ain't regular, that ain't regular
Fallin' into the bed
Why would we ever do somethin' instead of
Fallin' into the bed right now?
Imma break you off, let me be your motivation
To stay and give it tonight
And baby, turn around, let me give you innovation
Hey, 'cause I do it so right
Think about it, oh, think about it
Think about it, oh, take a look at me now
Hey, a little motivation, alright
You got a bad one, baby, don't you?
Got a bad one, baby, don't you?
And we both know there's no
One better boy, no one better boy
Too late, won't make it, Imma tell 'em
Get you naked but I won't tell 'em
'Cause you know that there's no
One better boy, no one better boy
Fallin' into the bed
Why would we ever do somethin' instead of
Fallin' into the bed right now
(Eh, right now now)
Imma break you off, let me be your motivation
To stay and give it tonight (and give it tonight)
And baby, turn around, let me give you innovation
Hey, 'cause I do it so right
Think about it, oh, think about it
Think about it, oh, take a look at me now
Hey, a little motivation, alright
Hey
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
A little motivation (a little motivation)
Imma break you off, let me be your motivation
To stay and give it tonight
And baby, turn around, let me give you innovation
Hey, 'cause I do it so right
Think about it, oh, think about it
Think about it, oh, take a look at me now
Hey, a little motivation, alright
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
