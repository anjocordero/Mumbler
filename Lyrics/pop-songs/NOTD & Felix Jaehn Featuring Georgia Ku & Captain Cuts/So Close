Thinkin' about you
As I'm lyin' next to someone else
Drinkin' without you, hm
Doesn't fix me but it kinda helps
Oh I still wish we could go back
To where we started
When you left your t-shirt
At my old apartment
Have you ever wondered
If you loved me harder
Where we'd be
Where we'd be now
Yeah we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough
When we got so close, so close to love
Yeah we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough
When we got so close, so close to love
I never noticed
I was busy tryna work this out
Why was I holdin' on,
When I knew you'd only let me down?
But I still wish we could go back
To where we started
When you left your t-shirt
At my old apartment
Have you ever wondered
If you loved me harder
Where we'd be
Where we'd be now
Yeah we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough
When we got so close, so close to love
Yeah we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough
When we got so close, so close to love
When we got so close, so close to love
(Yeah we got so close
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much
When we got so close, so close to love)
Yeah we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough
When we got so close, so close to love
Yeah we got so close, so close to love
