Am I the only one who's been mistaken?
'Cause you're the only one who keeps me waiting
Do you know how much time I would be saving
If I didn't let you into my head, let you into my bed?
Oh, no, I've done it again
Haven't I been here before, here before?
Oh, Lord, my hand on my hip
Haven't I been here before, here before?
So stop, stop saying that you're mine
I'ma need a better reason to be spending all my time with you
You leave me, I'll be fine
I'ma need a better reason to be wasting my time with you
Wasting, wasting my time with you
Wasting, wasting my time with you
Wasting, wasting my time with you
Time with you
Baby, I know you've been misbehaving
I've been cleaning up the mess that you've been making
Do you know how much time I would be saving
If I didn't let you into my head, let you into my bed?
No, no, I've done it again
Haven't I been here before, here before?
Oh, Lord, my hand on my hip
Haven't I been here before, here before?
So stop, stop saying that you're mine
I'ma need a better reason to be spending all my time with you
You leave me, I'll be fine
I'ma need a better reason to be wasting my time with you
Wasting, wasting my time with you
Wasting (I've been wasting my time with you) wasting my time with you
Wasting (I've been wasting my time with you) wasting my time with you
Time with you
Oh, stop, stop saying that you're mine
I'ma need a better reason to be spending all my time with you
You leave me, I'll be fine
I'ma need a better reason to be wasting my time with you
Wasting, (Wasting my time) wasting my time with you
Wasting, (I've been wasting my time with you, babe) wasting my time with you
Wasting, (I've been wasting my time with you) wasting my time with you
Wasting my time with you, babe, mm
