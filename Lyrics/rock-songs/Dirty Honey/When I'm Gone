I'm down and out, I'm on my knees
Been working so hard to fill my needs
'Cause I got bitten by a hand that feeds
And I'm burning cash like gasoline
I'm back to the grind
All I wanted to say
Is I've been walking this line too long
And all I wanted to say
You know time has come, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
I got no shelter in the driving rain
I got no lady to ease my pain
I've got an empty bottle with an empty glass
Could somebody please just make this pass
I'm back to the grind, yeah
And all I wanted to say
Is I've been walking this line too long
And all I wanted to say
You know the time has come, so don't miss me when I'm gone
And all I wanted to say
Is I've been walking this line for too long
And all I wanted to say
You know the time has come, so don't miss me when I'm gone
No, don't miss me when I'm gone
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
No, no
No, no, no, no, no
Don't miss me when I'm gone
