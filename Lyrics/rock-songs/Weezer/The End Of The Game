Hey, Suzy, where you been today?
I'm looking for you every way
No sign of you when I wake up
I'm on an island with no sun
I feel like I've known you my whole life
You got me cryin' like when Aslan died
Now you're gone
The melody can't find you
I'm incomplete without you
I guess we've reached the end of the game
Oh-ooh, hit me!
I know that you would crank this song
Air-guitaring with your headphones on
We dig the same type of melodies
The ones that get you next to me
I was Mick and you were Marianne (Marianne)
You would harmonize when I felt bad (I felt bad)
But now you're gone
The melody can't find you
I'm incomplete without you
I guess we've reached the end of the game
Oh-ooh, hit me!
Oh-ooh
Am I your go-to or am I uncool?
With all of these extremes that I go to
All I want is to be wanted by you
All I want is to be wanted by you
But the melody can't find you
I'm incomplete without you
I guess we've reached the end of the game
Oh-ooh, hit me!
Oh-ooh, hit me!
Oh-ooh, hit me!
Oh-ooh, hit me!
