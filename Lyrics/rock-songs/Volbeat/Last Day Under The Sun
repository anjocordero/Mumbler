I'm in the lion's cave
I've done it all before
I feel alive again
But maybe not for long
Another day will come
Full of light and desire
Is your life okay?
Is it who you are?
Are you right on track?
Or has it gone too far?
Well, only you will know
Don't let the blues get you down
I'll be alone in the end
I'll be alone and blue, oh
Well, it's the last day under
Last day under the
Last day under
Last day under the
Last day under, under the sun
Yeah it's the last day under, under the sun
Nobody really knows
How many years went by
The lion left it's home, and now he's good and fine
Another day will come, full of light and desire
I'll be alone in the end
I'll be alone and blue, oh
Well, it's the last day under
Last day under the
Last day under
Last day under the
Last day under, under the sun
Yeah it's the last day under, under the sun
The memories are all we have
So keep them safe and sound
Nothing matters but what we learned
Get your feet back on the ground
Well it's the last day under
Last day under the
Last day under
Last day under the
Last day under, under the sun
It's the last day under
Last day under the
Last day under
Last day under the
Last day under, under the sun
Well it's the last day under
Last day under the
Last day under
Last day under the
Last day under, under the sun
Yeah, it's the last day under, under the sun, oh
Yeah, it's the last day under, under the sun
(Under the sun)
