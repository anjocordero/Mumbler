Watch me, take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week wasting time with people I don't like
I think, something's fucking wrong with me
Drown myself in alcohol, that shit never helps at all
I might say some stupid things tonight when you pick up this call
I've been hearing silence on the other side for way too long
I can taste it on my tongue, I can tell that something's wrong but
I guess it's just my life and I can take it if I wanna
But I cannot hide in hills of California
Because these hills have eyes, and I got paranoia
I hurt myself sometimes, is that too scary for you?
Watch me, take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week wasting time with people I don't like
I think, that something's fucking wrong with me
Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night
Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night
You take drugs to let go
And figure it all out on your own
Take drugs on gravestones
To figure it all out on your own
Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week wasting time with people I don't like
I think that something's fucking wrong with me
You'll find me alone at midnight
Inside my mind, trying to get things right
(Something's fucking wrong with me)
They want to keep you calling
So you don't wake in the morning
(Something's fucking wrong with me)
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight, yeah
You'll find me alone at midnight (Goodnight)
Inside my mind, trying to get things right (Goodnight)
They want to keep you calling (Goodnight)
So you don't wake in the morning (Goodnight)
