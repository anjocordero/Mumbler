Gloria
I smell it on your breath
Gloria
The booze and peppermint
Gloria
No one said enough is enough
Gloria
They found you on the floor
Gloria
My hand was tied to yours
Gloria
Did you finally see that enough is enough?
Did you know me when I was younger then?
I could take the whole world with me
I would find myself feel alone
Heaven help me now, heaven show the way
Get me back on my own two feet
I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gloria
You crawled up on your cross
Gloria
You made us sit and watch
Gloria
No one said enough is enough
Heaven help me now, heaven show the way
Get me back on my own two feet
I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me
Every night awake, every day alone
Get me back on my own two feet
I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gloria
Will you just decide?
Gloria
There's easier ways to die
Gloria
Have you had enough?
