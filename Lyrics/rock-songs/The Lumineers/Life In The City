Whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa
And if the city's skyscrapers rise over this island
Would you be glad to see Manhattan for once?
I knew the dream, it died
JMZ line, Myrtle and Broadway
But I'd be glad to see Manhattan for once
Whoa-whoa, living life in the city
Whoa-whoa, it will never be pretty
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-whoa, we can plan if we make it
Whoa-whoa, we won't let 'em
They won't take it from me
No-oh-oh, whoa
Whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa
And if you leave, don't leave me all alone
'Cause I'll be scared, I'll be naked, I'll be cold
And I miss my dad, Cleopatra sitting on the phone
So take me back off these streets and we'll never be apart
Together from the start
Never, never, falling back alone
Oh-whoa, living life in the city
Oh-whoa, it will never be pretty
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-whoa, we can plan if we make it
Oh-whoa, we won't let 'em
They won't take it from me
No-oh-oh, whoa
And if the sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you just lay down and dig your grave
Or will you rail against the dying day
Da-da-da, da da-da, da da-da
Da-da-da, da da-da, da da-da
Da-da-da, da da-da, da da-da
Da-da-da, da da-da, da da-da
