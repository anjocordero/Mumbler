A bottle for breakfast trying to let go
Remember your voice but it's only an echo
I still got your makeup here on my pillow
And I'm seeing ghosts outside of my window
It was just one time
One time
Started turning into two times
A few times
Ain't been sober in a long time
A long time
Yeah you used to be all mine
All mine
It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I got my head hung over you
I guess I'm still hungover you
I was so wasted I couldn't see you
Didn't seem like a choice, no I'd never leave you
Nights that we stayed up days that we'd sleep through
I can still see your face outside of my window
It was just one time
One time
Started turning into two times
A few times
Ain't been sober in a long time
A long time
Yeah you used to be all mine
All mine
It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I got my head hung over you
I guess I'm still hungover you
(I got my head hung over you)
(I guess I'm still hungover you)
A bottle for breakfast trying to let go
Remember your voice but it's only an echo
It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I got my head hung over you
I guess I'm still hungover you
It feels like last night (Last night)
You came over (You came over)
Now I wake up (Now I wake up)
And you're nowhere (And you're nowhere)
I got my head hung over you
I guess I'm still hungover you
(I got my head hung over you)
(I guess I'm still hungover you)
