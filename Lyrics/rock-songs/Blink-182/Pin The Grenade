Back down, off the ledge you're leaving me
Right now, it feels like you're bleeding me dry
Slow down, you took away a piece of me
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go
Chokehold, I'm running out of oxygen
Tightrope, tonight it's like I'm walking on air
Black smoke, coming from the underground
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let
Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Hey! Wait! Get out of my brain
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me, baby, please just do it slow
So hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
My god, how could you talk to me like that?
Let's stop, you changed your mind and caught a ride home
You dropped a hint that I embarrass you
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go
Midnight, I'm underneath the landslide
Fast life, I'll leave you on the side of the road
You cried, "this isn't what you promised me"
I don't wanna let go, don't wanna let
Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Hey! Wait! Get out of my brain
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me, baby, please just do it slow
So hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
(Lie to my face)
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me, baby, please just do it slow
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me, baby, please just do it slow
Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Hey! Wait! Get out of my brain
If you don't love me, lie to my face
Just another night before I'm lost and all alone
If you're gonna kill me, baby, please just do it slow
So hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face
If you don't love me, lie to my face
If you don't love me, lie to my face
(Hey! Wait! Pin the grenade!
If you don't love me, lie to my face)
