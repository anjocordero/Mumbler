[Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba):]
I don't believe that we were ever meant to be
Left underneath the light of dying stars (dying stars)
Push me off of the edge of the world (of the world)
Watch me as I slowly fall apart
Set fire to the roof of your house
And waited for the sirens to wail (sirens wail)
Left your favorite records to melt (left to melt)
Listen as you damn me to hell
[Mark Hoppus:]
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me
[Matt Skiba:]
Well, what did I think would happen?
I wouldn't dream of asking
You waited here for me so long
I lived in fear that you moved on
What have I done to us, it seems?
I've broken trust and shattered dreams
I only wish I'd spoken up
Loneliness since we broke up
[Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba):]
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me
(Heaven doesn't want me)
(Heaven doesn't want me)
[Matt Skiba:]
Say a prayer that you'll make it to the other side
It won't make no sense and you lose your mind
We're lost in our ways (we're lost in our ways)
Nothing left to say, no (nothing left to say)
Make a wish that you'll get a chance to say goodbye
Before the shots ring out in the dead of night
We're stuck in our ways (we're stuck in our ways)
I've got so much to say, oh (I've got so much to say)
Showed up like shadows in this crowd
Brought the fire blinding
Came here to quickly tear us down, down, down
[Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba):]
Angel wings at the bus stop (Whoa)
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me (Whoa)
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me
