Tragedy (Tragedy)
Erased my memory (Erased my memory)
And now all I see
Is this black rain
Oh tragedy
You took my everything (You took my everything)
Oh now all I feel
All I feel is pain
Oh, how can I go on?
Knowing that I lost you
Where did I go wrong?
Where did you run off to?
Lost down here, broken and alone
I went in search of some answers
But all I found were monsters
They're under my bed
They're haunting this tie
That's been severed
This tie that's been severed
Now I follow your footsteps
Through the ashes you once crept
I feel so hollow now
I'm trapped on this island
This island of regret
Tragedy (Tragedy)
Erased my memory (Erased my memory)
And now all I see
Is this black rain
Oh tragedy
You took my everything (You took my everything)
Oh now all I feel
All I feel is pain
Oh, how can I go on?
Knowing that I lost you
Where did I go wrong?
Where did you run off to?
Lost down here, broken and alone
They left a note on the front door
With a time and a place as the tears poured from my eyes
Straight to the floor there was no going back once we knew what they came for
And all I have here is heartache
And bones, and mirrors for me to break
Only so much bad luck a person can take
We quiver and quake, we shiver and shake
Tragedy (Tragedy)
Erased my memory (Erased my memory)
And now all I see
Is this black rain
Oh tragedy
