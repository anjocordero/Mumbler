First drink of the night just to get me right
The first light of the day, I know I got it all wrong
First pill that you drop only sets it off
The next morning you wake up all blurry and numb
Before all the damn insecurities
Before all your innocence is all lost
Think back to the time you were all alone
One day you'll look back and say, "where's it all gone?"

Sometimes we get lost inside our little heads
Don't sleep, just yet, we all know that there's nothing like the
(First love, first high, there ain't nothing like the first time
Passed out, last night, there ain't nothing like the first time)
Taking all the meds (First love)
Sleeping with your friends (First high)
Find out in the end, there ain't (There ain't)
Nothing like the first time (Nothing like the first time)
Stuck inside her head (Passed out)
Jumping in her bed (Last night)
Find out in the end, there ain't (There ain't)
Nothing like the first time (Nothing like the first time)

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah...

First time on a plane, so she's paranoid
Tried to make her feel safe, but said it all wrong
First time in L.A., so she can't avoid
Feeling like she's failing all along
