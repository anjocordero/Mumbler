Leave me in the sun, I'm melting like a Popsicle
Give me the flu, I'm dying in this hospital
I need you close but you got me backed against a wall
I try to speak but my mouth doesn't move at all
Sing me right back to sleep
I'll never hear your voice break down again
Need you to try to keep
Your distance and I'll come home again
Run away
Don't let me run away, no
Get away
Don't let me get away, no
When the lights come up and you see I'm gone
You wake up to an empty house
And when the music stops and you come undone
You know I'm never gonna get you out (of my head)
Met you in the dark where we stumble into mysteries
An open book that you took and now I'm history
You moved away and you left me with your dying wish
I couldn't prove it was you, you're the arsonist
Sing me right back to sleep
I'll never hear your voice break down again
Need you to try to keep
Your distance and I'll come home again
Run away
Don't let me run away, no
Get away
Don't let me get away, no
When the lights come up, when you see I'm gone
Wake up to an empty house
And when the music stops and you come undone
You know I'm never gonna get you out (of my head)
Run away
Don't let me run away, no
Get away
Don't let me get away, no
Run away
Don't let me run away, no
Get away
Don't let me get away, no
When the lights come up, when you see I'm gone
Wake up to an empty house
And when the music stops and you come undone
You know I'm never gonna get you out (of my head)
Run away
Don't let me run away, no
Get away
Don't let me get away, no
