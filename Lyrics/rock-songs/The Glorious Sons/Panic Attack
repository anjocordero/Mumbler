I wanna be normal
I wanna be sane
I wanna look at you and feel something other than pain
I need shelter
Safe haven
I wanna quiet place to go and wait out the rain
I wanna woman
I wanna job
I got an urge coming on to get in trouble again
I wanna wake up
And feel loved
Will you look me in the eyes, tell me I'm not dying
I'm losing air
I'm not prepared for this
I'm tired
I'm sick
I'm waging war on everything
I'm wired
I'm licked
I'm addicted to everything
But I'm not prepared for this
Tell me I'm not dying
I wanna hole
To crawl in
I wanna sleep till I can't feel anything
I wanna fix
I wanna friend
I wanna cut these nerves from under my skin
I need a woman
I need a job
I got an urge coming on to get in trouble again
I wanna wake up
And feel loved
Will you look me in the eyes, tell me I'm not dying
I'm losing air
I'm not prepared for this
I'm tired
I'm sick
I'm waging war on everything
I'm wired
I'm licked
I'm addicted to everything
But I'm not prepared for this
Tell me I'm not dying
I'm tired
I'm sick
I'm waging war on everything
I'm wired
I'm licked
I'm addicted to everything
But I'm not prepared for this
No I'm not prepared for this
Tell me I'm not dying
Tell me I'm not dying
Tell me I'm not dying
