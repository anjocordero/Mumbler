Life is degrading and silently making
Me spun out inside my own head
Spewing and craving this darkness is baiting me
Down the road to my own death
I can't take this
I might break it
Watch it all fall down
So come give me
The truth you hide
Take the pain inside
Humiliating, I fold to its craving
It feeds on the doubt in my heart
Sinking and fading are feelings I'm saving
To fix what I tore all apart
I can't take this
I might break it
Watch it all fall down
So come give me
The truth you hide
Take the pain inside
I'm lost
You'll never find me
I'm lost
You'll never find me
I'm lost
You'll never find me
I'm lost
You'll never find me
I'm lost
You'll never find me
I'm lost
You'll never find me
I'm lost
You'll never find me
I'm lost
So come give me
The truth you hide
Take the pain inside
I'm lost
You'll never find me
I'm lost
You'll never find me
I'm lost
You'll never find me
I'm lost
Come for me
I'm not doing fine...
