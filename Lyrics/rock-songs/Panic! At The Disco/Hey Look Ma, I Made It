All my life been hustling and tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker selling songs and my pimp's a record label
This world is full of demons, stocks, and bonds, and bible traders
So I do the deed, get up and leave, a climber and a sadist, yeah
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo hoo
Hey look Ma, I made it
Hey look Ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
And if it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said hey look Ma, I made it
Friends are happy for me, or they're honeysuckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals or they wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers while these other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust then trust me, you'll be lonely, oh
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo hoo
Hey look Ma, I made it
Hey look Ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said hey look Ma, I made it, I made it
I said hey look Ma, I made it, I made it
I see it, I want it, I take it, take it
And if it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said hey look Ma, I made it
(Mama best believe it)
(Mama best believe it) Hey look Ma, I made it
(Think I must be dreamin')
(Wide awake and dreaming) Hey look Ma, I made it
(Mama best believe it)
(Mama best believe it) Hey look Ma, I made it
(Think I must be dreamin')
Hey look Ma, I made it
