I'm such a bore
I'm such a bummer
There must be more
Behind the summer
I want someone
To make some trouble
Been way too safe
Inside my bubble
Oh, take me out and keep me up all night
Let me live on the wilder side of the light
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
You carnivore
You loose cannon
Can I have some more?
I can't understand it
You fast car
You foolish spender
You know you are
And I surrender
So come on over
And wake me up
Put some of your tequila
In my coffee cup
You know I need ya
And that's for sure
You're just the kind of crazy
I've been looking for
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
(Where the sun hits my face all different)
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
