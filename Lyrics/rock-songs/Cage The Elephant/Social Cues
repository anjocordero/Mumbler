I think it's strange when people say
You're the next big thing, you'll never fade
The slightest touch, forced to fold
Sleight of the hand, modern gold
Starry-eyed child left behind
Choose your favorite vice
I don't have the strength to play nice
Hide me in the back room
Tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room
Tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
I'll be in the back room
Tell me when it's over
People always say, "man, at least you're on the radio"
At least you're on the radio
(At least you're on the radio)
At least you're on the radio
Close your eyes, don't be afraid
Take some of these, they'll ease the pain
Live fast, die young, pay the price
The best die young, immortalised
Starry-eyed children left behind
To choose their favorite vice
I don't have the strength to think twice
Hide me in the back room
Tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room
Tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
I'll be in the back room
Tell me when it's over
People always say, "man, at least you're on the radio"
At least you're on the radio
(At least you're on the radio)
Hide me in the back room
Tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room
Tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
I'll be in the back room
Tell me when it's over
People always say, "man, at least you're on the radio"
At least you're on the radio
