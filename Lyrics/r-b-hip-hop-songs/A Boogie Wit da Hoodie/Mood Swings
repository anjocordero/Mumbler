She was my bestie, never know she was so nasty, yeah
And she so sexy, kissin' on bitches like lesbians, yeah

Yeah, niggas wanna test me, snipe a nigga

Big ass bag with the big Lambo'

Lost my bro, lost my mind
Want my soul, niggas want my life

Fuck two set of twins like a couple of times
Fuck few set of twins like a couple of times
Percocets, two time
