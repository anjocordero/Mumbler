Baby Jesus
This DaBaby
You already know it
Name of this mix-tape is So Disrespectful
I'm 'bout to be so disrespectful
I recorded all 10 songs at the crib
Some of 'em in my boxers, some of 'em in my socks
Some of 'em butt-ass naked
Some of these songs I recorded, your bitch was right behind me sitting on the bed, nigga, go ask her, she might keep it real with you
We gon' be so disrespectful
Ain't no hooks on none of these songs
I'm giving it to you
Niggas finna get this work
