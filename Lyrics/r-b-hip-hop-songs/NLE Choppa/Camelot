I ain't gon' say too much when a nigga speakin' on that hot shit
Fuck the police, 'cause them bitches ain't gon' stop shit
Oppositions mad, if they play they gettin' popped quick
Flyest nigga in the game, yeah, I'm a cockpit
Posted on Camelot, wit' a hunnid some' shots
I be swimmin' wit' the sharks, lil nigga you are lost
Bullets hit a nigga up, like he eatin' on some pasta
And shoutout to Kingston, I keep me some Rastas
My niggas trappin' out the bando, shoutout to the Migos
If a nigga knock wrong, shoot him through the peephole
The trap always open, bitch we ain't never closed
We movin' them packs and we movin' them kilos
Step one, Step two, do my dance in this bitch
Got a hunnid some' drums like a band in this bitch
Mane she keep on pissin', all that naggin' and shit
Hoe shut the fuck up and jus' gag on this dick
I'm a side nigga, and I love when she swallow
If a nigga say something, hit him wit' a hollow
That glizzy, knock ya meat out ya taco
Flexin' on ya bitch, they call me Johnny Bravo
School of hard knocks, let me take you to class
My bitch is real skinny but she got a fat ass
