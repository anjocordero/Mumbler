Sabes bien que fue un engaño
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado
Así mismo me engañaste
Y lloras hoy porque fallaste
Cómo tratas de buscarme
Después que tú me traicionaste
Ahora tengo que alejarme
Busqué la forma de olvidarte
(We The Best Music!) Oh na-na, oh na-na
Oh na-na, oh na-na (Another one)
(DJ Khaled)
Why, oh why
You stay, you stay
And cry every night?
You stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh why
You stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal
You stay, you stay
I don't know how you do it, but you did it
I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga
It's not my business
But I can tell you that his level's no competition
And um, hard to miss it and um, 'bout to hit it and um
I can tell you been cryin' in Honda Civics because
I caught you slippin', left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I'll wipe your face with them new hunnids to make your tears dry
Hittin' it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasin' dreams and it ain't even bed time
And don't you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder why, oh why
Do you ride, do you stay by his side
If it makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you
I think you too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's for real
That ain't the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that, baby you can shake that
Hit the gym and get your shape back
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga
With your mind and your heart and your soul
For your goals, in control, you're letting go
I just wanna see you happy
I just wanna see you laughing
I just wanna see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who believe about you
Who gon' see about you 'cause it's been a while, so baby
Why, oh why
Do you ride, do you stay by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal
You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day he'll grow up and be a man
And lately you been pourin' out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playin' your part from the start, I understand
I'd put carats on your hand
But see, I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world, but I promise it be better than last time
As long as you loyal
You got a plan, I'd do more than spoil you
I'd be there to support you
Drop-top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision I'm with you, no askin' why
I catch you slippin' at all, you gon' be mine
Ma, la verdad
Es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillan
Me dan luz, son los que me fascinan
No hay quien te gane
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay
Tell me why you (Another one)
Ma, la verdad
Es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillan
Me dan luz, son los que me fascinan
No hay quien te gane
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal
