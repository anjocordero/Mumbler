All ’em other dudes had their chance, now they out of luck
When I bust a nut, I don’t never wanna cuddle, no
I went to the club, and guess who I seen?

I told one of the macks, "Yo, back the thing out"
Ain’t showin' off my jewels, but shots gon' ring out

Down Rodeo, now I'm spendin' large amounts on it
Swipe the platinum, I might empty my accounts on it—sheesh
She said her man's a jerk
So I pulled up while her man's at work (Monkey on the dick, I got–)

Bad bitches in the lobby but they wait for me (Huh)

Give me a lap dance, she said, "This one for free"
She feelin' on my D, askin' can she have it please
And she know I like it (Yeah)
