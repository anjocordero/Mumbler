Found out I cheated on her, she'll still feed me grapes
Tryna fight temptation, something I need to pray about
Tried to talk to the Pastor, find out he doin' the same thing
Been havin' a secret relationship on his main thing
You ain't no different from me, young nigga tryin' to maintain
I'm going for clarity, I don't gotta change names
I want a stripper but I'm gettin' tired of the same thing
