He be reading my mind like it's simple
Got him banging my line like it's his too
Never gotta worry 'bout no issues
He pay it on time when the rent due
Made him ice out my neck and the wrist too
Hold down your pussy and your pistol (Let him know, girl)

Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can't leave 'em alone (Can't leave 'em alone)
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin' me on

Hair done, nails done like a bad bitch
Niggas turned me to a savage
I can't fuck him if he average
Way more bad than your last bitch (Period)
