Mirror, mirror on the wall
Don't say it, 'cause I know I'm cute (Ooh, baby)
Louis down to my drawers
LV all on my shoes (Ooh, baby)
I be drippin' so much sauce
Gotta been looking like Ragu (Ooh, baby)
Lit up like a crystal ball
That's cool, baby so is you
That's how I roll
If I'm shinin' everybody gonna shine (Yeah, I'm gold)
I was born like this, don't even gotta try (Now you know)
I'm like chardonnay, get better over time (So you know)
Heard you say I'm not the baddest bitch, you lie (Haha)
Ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
Ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
No, I'm not a snack at all
Look, baby, I'm the whole damn meal (Ooh, baby)
Baby, you ain't bein' slick
Don't dare try to cop a feel (Ooh, baby)
The juice ain't worth the squeeze
If the juice don't look like this (Like this, like this, like this)
Huh, nigga please, don't make me have to take your bitch
(How I roll)
If I'm shinin' everybody gonna shine (Yeah, I'm gold)
I was born like this, don't even gotta try (Now you know)
I'm like chardonnay, get better over time (So you know)
Heard you say I'm not the baddest bitch, you lie
Ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
Ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Somebody come get this man
I think he got lost in my DMs, what?
My DMs, what?
You better come get your man
I think he wanna be way more than friends, what?
More than friends
What you want me to say?
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
