Yeah, yeah
Let me catch ya vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind and take it easy
Don't have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don't have to be mine, let's take it easy
Damn, we so fi', bae
Whippin' through the 305 highway
Love it how you ride in the fast lane
Make me wanna say, "That's my babe," yeah
Dani gotta behave, gotta be chill like a Sunday
Never wanna look too thirsty
But your drip got me feeling wavy
Make you feel lucky, lucky
Make you wanna love me, love me
Baby, when you with me, with me
Got no worries, worries
I love it when you touch me, touch me
Feelin' so lovely, lovely
Make me wanna love me, love me
Make me feel lucky, lucky
Let me catch ya vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind and take it easy
Don't have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don't have to be mine, let's take it easy
Hey, yeah
Let's take it easy

[Chris Brown:]
When you pull up on my side babe
Speeding on that 101 highway
Moving too fast can you feel the pace
Cause you see that look in my face
And you know what it is
Pedal to the metal all gas no brakes
Girl I would never get in your way
I'm gone shut up and let you drive
Put that thing to the floor
One for the ride
[DaniLeigh & Chris Brown:]
Make you feel lucky, lucky (lucky)
