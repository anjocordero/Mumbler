Everybody sing
How could you come up out your face and say I ain't the hottest
Nigga you done never heard
I left a flock of rappers dead and burned
A verse from me is like eleven birds
I did the math it's like 2000 dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
And told them niggas that they gotta wait for me
I know, I know you in hot demand
I'm balling on a pussy nigga like Jauwanna Mann
I'm drowning all inside the pussy like I never swam
Ayy, fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man (Ayy, ayy)
