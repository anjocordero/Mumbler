Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain
I just thought it didn't rain in California
Baby, I know love isn't what I thought it was
'Cause I've never known love like this before, oh, yeah
Baby, I know dreams tend to crumble at extremes
I just thought our dream would last a little bit longer
There's a time when every man draws a line down in the sand
We're surviving, we're still living, I'm stronger
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?
Baby, I know hate is always waiting at the gate
I just thought we'd lock the gate when we left in the morning
When I was told that war is how we landed on these shores
I just thought the drums of war beat louder warnings
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?
Baby, I know death probably hasn't happened yet
'Cause I don't remember living life before this
And, darling, our disease is the same one as the trees
Unaware that they've been living in a forest
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?
This life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?
