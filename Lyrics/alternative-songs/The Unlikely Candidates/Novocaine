I keep it coming so I feel no pain
I tell my girl that I'm 'a change my ways
She knows I'm never gonna change (change)
Same old shit
Runnin' my mouth until she busts my lip
So many problems, you can take your pick
I know I'm never gonna change (change)
I am what I am
I know what I know
I'll let you down if you let me too close
I am what I am
I know what I know
You'll catch me runnin' away then you'll know
I can't change
Guess you could blame it on my left-side brain
I should know better but you know
I know, I know
I ain't ever gonna change
Got no shame
Spent all my money soon as I got paid
I should know better but you know
I know, I know
I ain't ever gonna change
Wonder why the party's over soon as I arrive
Must've done something in a former life
And I don't really wanna change
Change!
I am what I am
I know what I know
I'll let you down if you let me too close
I am what I am
I know what I know
You'll catch me runnin' away then you'll know
I can't change
Guess you could blame it on my left-side brain
I should know better but you know
I know, I know
I ain't ever gonna change
Got no shame
Spent all my money soon as I got paid
I should know better but you know
I know, I know
I ain't ever gonna change
Change
I am what I am
I know what I know
I'll let you down if you let me too close
I am what I am
I know what I know
You'll catch me runnin' away then you'll know
I am what I am
I know what I know
I'll let you down if you let me too close
I am what I am
I know what I know
You'll catch me runnin' away then you'll know
I am what I am
I know what I know
I'll let you down if you let me too close
I am what I am
I know what I know
You'll catch me runnin' away then you'll know
I can't change
Guess you could blame it on my left-side brain
I should know better but you know
I know, I know
I ain't ever gonna change
Well, I got no shame
Spent all my money soon as I got paid
I should know better but you know
I know, I know
I ain't ever gonna change
Change
