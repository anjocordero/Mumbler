(Don't sit around and complain about it)
I can't stand, waiting around to dance, uh huh
Don't wanna talk, already know what I want
You got big plans but you never take a chance, uh huh
When will ya stop wondering who you are?
I showed you mine, now show me yours
Are you down to get serious?
Your wild life, coast to coast
Make it last, let's take it slow
I can't stand, waiting around to dance, uh huh
When will you stop and look at the one you got?
You say you want to change this world
Well, do you really believe in magic?
But you can only change yourself
Don't sit around and complain about it
All your friends, they got the nicest things, uh huh
Travel a lot, I don't understand their job
In suspense, slipping right through my hands, uh huh
When will you stop wondering what they thought?
I showed you mine, now show me yours
Are you down to get spiritual?
Flying high, but I'm confused
You weren't always dripping in jewels
All of your friends, they got the nicest things, uh huh
Just don't expect them to pick up the check
You say you want to change this world
Well, do you really believe in magic?
But you can only change yourself
Don't sit around and complain about it
Now you're out on your own, don't know where you belong
Don't sit around and complain about it
You say you want to change this world
Don't sit around and complain about it
Don't sit around, sit around
Don't sit around and complain
Don't sit around, sit around
Don't sit around and complain about it
You say you want to change this world
Well you must really believe in magic
Stand up and show them who you are
Don't sit around and complain about it
Now you're out on your own, don't know where you belong
Don't sit around and complain about it
You say you want to change this world
Don't sit around and complain about it
