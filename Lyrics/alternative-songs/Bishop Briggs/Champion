Alone in my car
I'm in a parking lot
Darkest spot in my mind
My tongue is dry
Why do I crumble quickly
Stumble swiftly
Cursing myself
I burned the furniture
A million times in my head
I'm feeling low
Got nowhere to go
But back up again
You gotta get bruised
Before you get mad
You gotta fall down
Before you fight back
Was feeling so weak
But baby I'm strong
Little did I know
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
Nobody said
It'd be a easy ride
Obstacles in my way
Scars never change
Why do I crumble quickly
Stumble swiftly
Cursing the world
I burned the songs I wrote
A billion times in my head
I'm feeling low
Got nowhere to go
But back up again
You gotta get bruised
Before you get mad
You gotta fall down
Before you fight back
Was feeling so weak
But baby I'm strong
Little did I know
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
You gotta get bruised
Before you get mad
You gotta fall down
Before you fight back
Was feeling so weak
But baby I'm strong
Little did I know
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
I'm a champion
