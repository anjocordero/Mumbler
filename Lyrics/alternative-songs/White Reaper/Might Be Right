So I woke up with a curse
I was searching I was looking through the purse
Taking measures to defend
Because you swore you'd always treat me like a friend
And I always fall
A little short in front of you
Yeah I always fall
A little short in front of you
Alright, and if you still won't go
Tell your sister that I told her so
Tie the shirt into another bow
Take a dip into the stash you stole
If you think I'm gonna leave that golden girl
Up alone all night
I may have tricked myself, she couldn't shake it
So I guess you might be right
So it's easy to believe
Well, I suppose it simply wasn't meant to be
Well, my mother told me first
She said, "When things start getting bad, look out, they might be getting worse"
And I always fall
A little short in front of you
Yeah I always fall
A little short in front of, a little short in front of you
Alright, and if you still won't go
Tell your sister that I told her so
Tie the shirt into another bow
Take a dip into the stash you stole
If you think I'm gonna lay that golden girl
Up alone all night
I may have tricked myself, she couldn't shake it
So I guess you might be right
We're gonna keep the lights down
Keep the lights down, keep the lights
Keep the lights down
Keep the lights down, keep the lights
Keep the lights down
Keep the lights down, keep the lights
Keep the lights down
Keep the lights down, keep the lights low
Alright, and if you still won't go
Tell your sister that I told her so
Tie the shirt into another bow
Take a dip into the stash you stole
If you think I'm gonna lay that golden girl
Up alone all night
I may have tricked myself, she couldn't shake it
So I guess you might be right
