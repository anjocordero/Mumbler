I see color
Raining down
Feral feeling
Swaying sound
But I don't know what you want
I am open
I am restless
Let me feel it out
Let it all come out
Wake me up
I'm fever dreaming
And now I lose control
I'm fever dreaming
Shake it out
It's just a-what I'm feeling
And now I take control
I'm fever dreaming
I'm fever dreaming
Oh so quiet
When they laid me in the stream
And the starlit sky
Grew before my eyes
Twenty-two women stood by the banks and cried
Oh ah
Wake me up
I'm fever dreaming
And now I lose control
I'm fever dreaming
Shake it out
It's just what I'm feeling
And now I take control
I'm fever dreaming
I'm fever dreaming
I must be fever dreaming
I'm fever dreaming
