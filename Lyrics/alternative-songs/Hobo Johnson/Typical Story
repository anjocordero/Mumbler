It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a...
Typical story where the bassist kills the singer, the guitarist and the drummer find they're in love with each other
It's the story of the kid who clearly won't know what to say when the love of his life starts to calmly walk away
And it's a story of the dad who decides to chase his dream; he quits his job, he falls apart, then he loses everything
And it's the story of the kid who just wants to make a record, loves and crafts it but nobody ever, ever cares about it
Woah
Hey, hey what's your name
Talk is for the guys you hate
We should sit in silence while we think of what to say
Hey, hey I don't think this is working out
Will you forget I even asked you to come over to my house
And hey, hey I don't think I know much but I know I couldn't take a good punch
So if you feel like I've been talking enough
Just tell me to shut up and I will gladly shut the fuck up
I'm afraid of everything staying the same or worsening
So what's the point of finding calm when calm to me is unsettling
Settle down, little kid, your bones are shaking in your skin
Go and try and take a breath, though nothing more, nothing less
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a
Typical story of the king who had it all except for citizens who didn't want his head up on a wall
It's the typical story of the wife who couldn't quit being in love with such a giant piece of shit
It's the story of the queen who could never, ever think of any redeeming qualities a man could ever bring
It's the story of the dog who wanted to run away 'til he learned that his life is way safer inside a cage
I don't really need much just a place to be alone and you won't really see much
I think that I'm invisible; my mirror shows another guy - a guy who doesn't do shit, he just sits and is miserable
Everybody's got a live a life that they didn't ask for
Why would he put me here just to die, just to, just to die!
