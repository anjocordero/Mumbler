It took me sixteen years to find ya
One second to love ya
Seven years to hold ya
One minute to lose ya
Oh, God
Where did I go wrong?
Oh, God
Do you remember
All of the nasty shit you used to do with me
'Cause I remember everything
And do you remember
When we hopped the P and B to NYC
You were only 17
But that puppy love is over
We're so much older
Nothing's ever gonna feel the same way
That it did when we were younger
I wish that I could hold ya
Baby, I know it's over
We're never gonna feel it again
It took me sixteen years to find ya
One second to love ya
Seven years to hold ya
One minute to lose ya
Oh, God, eh
Where did I go wrong?
Yeah
Do you remember (oh)
When I was your king
And you were my queen
Yeah, 'cause I remember everything
Do you remember
When you told me you were holding
My future kid, eh
And all the joy that that would bring
Well I thought I was the father
But baby is not my daughter
But baby's a different color
And baby I'm not a brother
It was just too much to swallow
(You ripped my heart out)
But that puppy love is over
We're so much older
Nothing's ever gonna feel the same way
That it did when we were younger
I wish I could hold ya
But baby, I know that it's over
We're never gonna feel it again
Well, it took me sixteen years to find ya
One second to love ya
Seven years to hold ya
And just one minute to lose ya
Oh, God, yeah
Where did I go wrong? (yeah)
Where did you go?
(Oh)
And I'll say
I'm sorry if I ever see you again, oh
Cause on that day
I'll walk away
When you probably needed a friend
It took me sixteen years to find ya
One second to love ya
I don't trust you
But I still love ya
Oh, God
Where did I go wrong?
Where did you go?
Where did I go wrong?
Baby, it took me sixteen years to find ya
But only a second to love ya
Seven years to hold ya
And just one minute to lose ya
Oh, God (yeah)
Where did I go wrong?
Where did you go?
Where did we go wrong?
Said, where did we go wrong ?
Where did I go wrong? (yeah)
Oh yeah
